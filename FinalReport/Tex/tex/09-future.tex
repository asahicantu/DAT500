Possible future work includes classifying the collected news data, addressing the limitation discussed in section 8.2. This would allow the training of a Machine Learning model able to perform sentiment analysis on extracted news, labeling data as positive or negative with regards to cryptocurrency market impact.

Combining historical price data and labeled news data, a more accurate model for predicting cryptocurrency prices could be realized. Implementing automatic collection of price and news data on the Hadoop cluster, with the help of real-time sentiment analysis, would allow for a continuously improving prediction model.

Possible further improvements could be made by also considering factors such as technological improvements and social adoption.
