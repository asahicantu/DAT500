The idea of combining social media information with cryptocurrency trading remains unexplored for the lack of information available. This presents a potential to mature the project as a product with models to be trained on daily basis once new data is released. Although social media keeps nowadays a very important role for cryptocurrency trading decisions, there is no open source dataset nor code available to explore. The code developed for this project is now available on GitHub [8] and Kaggle [7]. It is therefore led for future work to exploit the findings on this project and tune the newsfeed dataset to properly classify it. Social media data such as Twitter would be interesting to be added to find the correlations and perform a Sentiment analysis for the trading decisions on daily basis. There would be, however, an inherent need to previously analyze such dataset. It is important to mention that beforehand the intention was to use any other social media dataset, no results were found, therefore the need to create one by itself. Also the state of the art for distributed systems is not mature enough to address this kind of problems since deep learning cannot be run on clusters yet for parallel computations and calculations, will be very interesting to retake the project and explore future functionalities once this features are released in future versions.
