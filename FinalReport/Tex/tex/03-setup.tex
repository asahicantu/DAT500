The system used for this for this project consisted of four virtual machines (VMs) running Ubuntu Server 16.04. Apache Hadoop version 3.2.1 was installed on each machine, and they were configured to run as a Hadoop cluster using the YARN resource manager. They were configured such that one VM acted as a master node, while the other three acted as slave nodes.
Apache Spark was installed using the 3.0.0 preview version, as this was the only version supporting Hadoop 3.2.1. In order to get Spark running on the VMs, Python version 3.8.1 was compiled from source and installed alongside the default Python 2.7.12.
