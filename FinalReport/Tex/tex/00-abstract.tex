The creation of cryptocurrency and its exponential adoption over the last three years  has led to the creation of many different exchange and tools to trade it via Internet. Unlike common stock trading, cryptocurrency works nonstop all year with simple and advanced interfaces, allowing anyone with a minimum investment to enter the market and exchange assets in real time, with high liquidity and asset availability. Because of the early state of the technology and the socioeconomic-political factors affecting the regulation of the cryptocurrency markets as well as the speed at which transactions are made has led to a high risk-high volatility market, making very hard to analyze or predict prices that can lead to profits for a chosen currency. This academic report contains a deep analysis on crypto market and aims to generate a prediction model by analyzing historical data, the news and events that can potentially affect the market and its impact on the prices by using distributed systems Hadoop® and Apache Spark® for data storage and interaction. Machine Learning models are implemented as well for a big data set. Further analysis, results and potential for future work is presented in this report.
