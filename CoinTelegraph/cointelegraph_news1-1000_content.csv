While trading volume could signal both sell and buy pressure, there are multiple factors pointing to a higher interest in buying the cryptocurrency.A recent Coinbase report explained that the 48 hours after the crash brought record-breaking numbers for the company compared to their yearly averages. Purchasing pressure in their retail brokerage increased by 7% from the typical 12-month average of 60%. Coinbase also reported an increase in cash and crypto deposits, new signups, as well as higher trading volumes.Another factor pointing towards buy pressure or at least a lack of sell pressure is the BTC exchange net inflow, derived from the number of coins leaving and entering exchanges, which has dropped sharply after a spike in the Bitcoin selloff during mid-March.Google trends see uptick in Bitcoin interestThe interest in buying Bitcoin can also be observed in Google search trends. After the price crash, queries for the term “Buy Bitcoin” reached the highest level seen since July 23, 2019.

42574, Bitcoin’s Hedging Performance in the Wake of the Coronavirus Outbreak ,2020-04-04t22:41:00+01:00,2626,136,"The recent coronavirus outbreak has far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease and efforts to quarantine it. Recently, we’ve experienced one of the most severe stock market crashes in modern times: On March 9, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a drop of -7.8%, which happened to be its worst single-day loss ever. However, on Thursday, March 12, 2020, the Dow then recorded the fifth-largest drop in modern history based on percentage points by a staggering amount of almost 10%. Unfortunately, the losses did not stop there. Four days later, on March 16, the Dow hit a new record of almost 13%. Since the COVID-19 outbreak became an international issue, it is unsurprising that equity markets worldwide have experienced severe losses.In acknowledging the ability of Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge stock market risk, some economists and researchers refer to Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Some studies argue that Bitcoin is exposed to tail-risk only within the crypto markets, but it is not exposed to tail-risk with respect to other asset markets, such as equity markets or gold. However, the recent COVID-19 outbreak is a tail-risk event — or what Nassim Taleb refers to as a so-called “Black Swan” because it is an outlier — and it carries an extreme and consequential impact.Related: Is Bitcoin a Store of Value? Experts on BTC as Digital GoldIn my recent study, I explored the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and United States stocks during the COVID-19 outbreak, using a so-called difference-in-differences approach. Since the potential impact on the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks was unpredictable (and therefore uncertain), the study uses the COVID-19 outbreak as a quasi-experimental setting. In doing so, the study uses the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks as a treatment group, whereas the dynamic correlation between gold and U.S. stocks serves as the control group.Surprisingly, the study found that Bitcoin performed poorly in hedging this Black Swan event. Specifically, using a 20-day rolling-sample window to estimate the empirical distribution of the realized dynamic correlation, the realized correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks was -0.0208 in the period from April 17, 2015, to October 31, 2019, which is used as a before-the-event sample in this study. Confirming earlier studies, the correlation was insignificant.As the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the study employed the sample from March 12, 2020, to March 18, 2020, as an after-the-event period. Interestingly, the correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks was 0.6353 in the after-the-event sample period and statistically significant. Controlling for gold confirms this result.While the study shows that gold, indeed, lived up to its expectation to serve as a safe haven in times of troubles, Bitcoin turned out to be a curse rather than “digital gold.”To sum up, the study employed the outbreak of the pandemic as a quasi-experimental design to investigate the hedging abilities of Bitcoin — which has been referred to as “digital gold” to highlight its renowned abilities to hedge risk investment for various financial asset classes in particular stocks. The study’s findings suggest that Bitcoin performed poorly in hedging this extraordinary tail risk in U.S. stocks. Unlike earlier research, the findings suggest that Bitcoin is indeed exposed to (extraordinary) tail risks in other asset classes such as stocks.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Klaus Grobys is a docent in financial economics at the University of Jyväskyla and an assistant professor of finance at the University of Vaasa.

42573, SEC Alleges Minority Communities Targeted By Bottled Water Scam ,2020-04-04t21:58:00+01:00,5375,96,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a former pastor and his wife for stealing $500,000 through a trio of fraudulent businesses, including a cryptocurrency offering purportedly backed by a bottled water business.According to a complaint filed on April 2, the pair also sold fake shares in their struggling water business, Teshuater, in addition to conjuring up a non-existent Bitcoin (BTC) mining outfit to dupe investors in Houston, Texas.Former pastor offers 1,400% returns overnightThe complaint alleges that Larry and Shuwana Leonard “targeted investors in the African-American community by promising oversized returns on various investments related to Teshua”, a business that bottled and distributed alkaline water.”The SEC asserts that the former Christian pastor “capitalized on his background as ‘a man of the cloth’ to gain investors’ trust,” and began defrauding investors during Spring 2017.In the 45-year-old pair’s first scheme, “worthless ‘stock certificates’ that did not actually convey ownership interest in Teshuater” were issued in exchange for roughly $291,000. Investors were promised “short-term investment returns of up to 3,000 percent” over just a few days.The SEC states that Teshuater “earned little-to-no profit since its inception,” and was touted to investors as “the first black-owned alkaline water company.”Leonard launches TeshuaCoin offeringA further $170,400 was accumulated from the sale of TeshuaCoin, a cryptocurrency that the couple claimed was backed by the sales of the Teshuater company. The Leonards had targeted a $20 million raise through the cryptocurrency.Larry claimed to divert investors’ funds into a “high-yield, short-term Bitcoin-mining program” that did not exist — generating a further $25,500.The crypto scams were promoted through social media, with the pair conducting Facebook Live webcasts purportedly on the topic of “wealth generation for the African-American community.”More than $500,000 stolen from parishionersBy December 2018, the scheme raised $500,000 from over 500 investors total, issuing “materially false and misleading statements” regarding how investors’ funds would be used.The stolen funds were commingled with Teshuater and other businesses operated by the Leonards, before being spent on a combination of personal expenses and other business activities.None of the investment contracts issued by the pair or the Teshua company were registered with the SEC. The pair are not licensed to issue securities.The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, the disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgement interest, and civil penalties against the pastor and his wife."
42572," April Fools, Celebrity Scams, & Manipulated Markets: Bad Crypto News of the Week ",2020-04-04t20:53:00+01:00,1801,83,"Bitcoin seems to be settling happily above $6,000 and is currently just north of $6,500 again. Let’s hope we’ve seen the last of those $5,000 movements and we’re ready for a steady climb back to double figures before the halving in mid-May. It’s getting closer.In the meantime, the Federal Reserve now appears to have merged into the federal government. An opinion piece in Bloomberg has described how an alphabet soup of financial programs intended to help the economy through the current crisis is allowing the government to buy up securities through the Fed. The result could allow the government to manipulate markets. That’s something to look forward to when this is all over.House Democrats have a better role in mind for the Fed. They want it to distribute the one-time payments of up to $1,200 through digital wallets. The World Health Organization also sees a role for blockchain technology in battling the coronavirus. It’s using a distributed ledger built on top of Hyperledger Fabricto help spot carriers and new hotspots.But maybe we should all be like Roger Ver. He’s been kicking back and tweeting comparisons of COVID-19 fatalities to road accident deaths and other illnesses such as malaria and flu. He’s even found a friend in John McAfee. On the other hand, Bitcoin trading means never having to stand in line at the bank.Binance looks set to buy CoinmarketCap in a deal that could be worth up to $400 million. Maybe it’s got something to do with CoinmarketCap’s new crypto-leader. On April 1, the Toilet Paper Token was top of the charts, with a massive trading volume and a circulating supply that was “out of stock.” This really is one time when paper money is more useful than digital coins.Looking abroad, what happens when you try to teach Kenyans about Bitcoin? Steven Msoh found hope in a place that’s already one of the world’s leading users of digital money. Students in Malta have built a Dapp for their elections. Russia, however, has postponed its cryptocurrency law, citing the coronavirus as the reason for the delay. All legislation in Russia has slowed. The law would have defined cryptocurrencies, prohibited the use of digital coins as payment, and issued digital assets. But it wouldn’t harm the work of exchanges.France is doing better. The country’s central bank is planning to run some experiments using a digital euro in transactions. The tests, the bank says, will not be long-term and they won’t be applied on a wide scale. And in Svalbard, Norway, the Bitcoin codebase is being put on ice. Or rather, it’s being put under ice. A copy of the code will join other open source software stored on film in a disused arctic mine as part of the Github Archive Program. Even code now is going into quarantine.The good news is that the crisis has made the crypto market look sane in comparison to the N95 mask market. Both have huge international demand and plenty of shenanigans.Also up to shenanigans is a scammer who’s been using the identity of French soccer player, Kylian Mbappé, in an allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. And Maze, a group of hackers, has deployed ransomware against insurance firm, Chubb.

42571," Staking, Consensus and the Pursuit of Decentralization ",2020-04-04t19:59:00+01:00,1078,52,"Oh, the wonders of decentralized consensus — that dream of permissionless blockchains to be censorship-resistant, trustless, collaborative and egalitarian for a potentially global community of users. While lofty in ideals, consensus is foundational for each crypto network, which must agree upon that most basic question of who decides what on the network.Decentralized consensus in the form of a proof-of-work mechanism was at the core of Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation when creating Bitcoin —all additional protocol elements stem from PoW’s ability to reach consensus regarding the digital ledger through the computational work of distributed individuals.In the decade that has transpired since, we’ve seen some of the shortcomings of proof-of-work, including its high energy costs, a consolidation in mining power to few massive mining pools and limited transaction bandwidth. As a result, there have emerged new mechanisms of decentralized consensus, most notably proof-of-stake and hybrid PoW/PoS systems. While the drawbacks of PoW have done little to impact Bitcoin’s dominance within the industry, they have led to most new projects to opt for the more scalable and energy-efficient proof-of-stake system.Despite PoS’s rise to prominence, it’s not a perfect mechanism either, and it’s worth investigating its strengths, shortcomings and potential improvements in more depth.Proof-of-stake: The many flavorsThe core functionality of a proof-of-stake system allows “validators” (rather than proof-of-work’s miners) to stake their assets in order to propose and vote on the next block (as opposed to solving PoW’s cryptographic function). While specific implementations vary, in general, the more a validator has staked, the more weight to their vote and the larger their reward — but also the larger amount of capital subject to penalty if acting maliciously.From this basic framework, a number of variations have arisen within the crypto industry. The most basic mechanism is a “pure proof-of-stake” system, like Algorand uses, which gives proportional voting and block proposal weight to each token holder’s “stake.” Unlike other systems, staking in PPoS does not require a user to go through any special process to stake, but rather all tokens are staked automatically, allowing all token holders to participate in governance. This is quite similar to a “bonded proof-of-stake” system, which Ethereum 2.0 plans to adopt, in which users must actively lock up their assets to stake, receive proportional voting power, and endure “slashing” penalties if they vote against consensus.In the bonded proof-of-stake system, anyone with the appropriate amount of capital can contribute to the network, which can raise two potential issues. If the amount of capital is too high, it greatly reduces the inclusivity of the network and concentrates power. But if it’s too low, the number of nodes that must reach consensus can be huge, slowing down the network. One potential solution to these issues is the “delegated proof-of-stake” system, such as is employed by the EOS network. In DPoS, network token holders vote for a limited number of delegates to act as the validators for the network. This both increases inclusivity of participation and limits the number of nodes necessary for consensus, leading to EOS’s high transaction rate of around 3,900 transactions per second. It does, however, mean that power is concentrated among EOS’s 21 elected Block Producers.Finally, there are the hybrid models like Tezo’s “liquid proof-of-stake,” which allows users to delegate their voting and staking rights or exercise those themselves, and like Decred’s “hybrid proof-of-stake” model, which combines elements of PoS and PoW with miners proposing blocks and token stakers acting as validators.The different iterations, innovations and hybrid models of consensus mechanisms demonstrate an obvious truth: Decentralized consensus is hard. It requires coordinating a community of rational actors to act in a way that is first and foremost advantageous to the community,not the individual. This requires extremely tight incentive structures and a constant balance of the risks of centralization in terms of security and trust with inefficiencies around decentralization.Advantages and challenges with proof-of-stakeThe balancing act that must be managed is often called the “scalability trilemma,” which alludes to the tradeoffs blockchain’s are required to make when considering decentralization, security and scalability (similar to the old “pick two: sleep, friends, school” in college). PoS models generally attempt to balance all three factors more than PoW, which typically emphasizes decentralization and security.The attempt at a more generalist approach comes with its own set of issues, some of which have been solved and some which continue today.In the early days of PoS implementation, there were two primary objections to the mechanism vs. PoW that revolved around the fact that stakers did not actually have anything at stake (the “nothing-at-stake” problem), which meant they could support an alternate version of the blockchain at no cost (the “long-range attack” problem). The nothing-at-stake problem raised the issue that if there was a fork in the chain, a validator’s optimal strategy would be to validate on every chain in order to receive their reward regardless of the fork’s outcome. The long-range attack problem is similar to a 51% attack, but the attacker rewrites the blockchain from the genesis block, which is possible in PoS because no work is necessary to rewrite a very long chain. These issues were solved with the concept of “slashing,” which penalizes a validator for supporting an incorrect version of the blockchain.These penalties, however, could have the side-effect of limiting the number of stakers, depending on their risk profile and technical capabilities. Of course, the goal of a blockchain is to have as many users as possible to stake and participate in the network. However, this can also introduce the “zero-holding equilibrium” problem, which is when no users want to ever hold tokens outside of staking because of the inflation of network’s tokens, thereby limiting actual usage and transactions.Trade-offs and trade-offs all the way down, it may seem — though many are only theoretical, at this point. In the wild, perhaps the most widespread practical problem of PoS systems is actually shared with PoW systems: a consolidation of power and capital to a limited number of major players and a feedback loop allowing those with the most power to gain more. This is true in terms of their governance power within the network, as well as their balance sheet in the broader world — allowing the wealthy and powerful to grow more wealthy and more powerful.In PoW, we see this with the major mining pools, which are able to gain more and more hash power at incremental cost. In PoS, we see this often with seed investors receiving large amounts of discounted tokens, which translates to more power and higher staking rewards. So, while more people can participate in staking compared to mining, there is still a considerable inequity.Possible solutionsMany of the aforementioned challenges, particularly those simply around incentive alignment, have been solved with innovations such as slashing, often created by the Ethereum Foundation and Casper. Issues of centralization and the concentration of power seem to be more difficult to solve for a platform like Ethereum, which has a concentration of whales because of its long history and early efforts within blockchain.Systems like delegated proof-of-stake are an interesting potential solution to both maximize participation and efficiency, though the result can feel quite centralized despite its democratic nature. Hybrid systems like those employed by Tezos and Decred are also interesting experiments that could prove effective in limiting monopolization of power by having multiple stakeholder groups and increased user agency.While these types of innovation, experimentation and ingenuity are necessary for the ecosystem’s development, we are often inclined to create more complex solutions than necessary. Historically, much of the centralization of PoS systems does not come from a technical or incentivization mechanic but from the nature of the initial distribution. Large token holders and institutions often receive the lion’s share of an initial distribution, cementing their status as central points of power and potentially of a failure within the network. One solution, then, would be to democratize access to token distribution from the earliest possible moment.This is currently the approach being taken in a partnership between CasperLabs, which is building a permissionless, high-performance PoS blockchain, and digital asset trading platform BitMax.io through their new joint solution: an exchange validator offering, or EVO. Rather than offering tokens to institutional investors, CasperLabs and BitMax are teaming up to give retail investors the opportunity to be the first to receive token distribution, such that they will operate as validators through BitMax when the network goes live. The elimination of the whale effect in initial distribution could go a long way to reducing any future monopolization of power in the network.Despite the numerous challenges of decentralized consensus (from a pre-launch blockchain all the way to Bitcoin), it’s encouraging to see continued innovation and experimentation in this realm, particularly which remains true to the fundamental ideals of trustlessness, security and decentralization.Learn more about BitMaxDisclaimer.

42570, Crypto Community Largely Approves of Binance Acquiring CoinMarketCap ,2020-04-04t18:30:00+01:00,2026,138,"Despite markets all over the world facing ever-worsening economic troubles amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it seems as though the crypto industry has been able to weather the storm, at least thus far. In this regard, Binance — the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange — has recently reached an agreement to acquire CoinMarketCap, one of the most prominent crypto data websites.The official announcement was made by both companies on April 2, with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao telling Cointelegraph that CMC and Binance have from the very start been working to make the crypto ecosystem more accessible to people all over the world. Additionally, he also believes that this latest deal will help the two companies build on each other’s strengths, as well as make the industry more transparent and approachable.Zhao further pointed out that his team had been in discussions with CMC for a few months and that he could not comment on the financial aspect of the deal since it has been legally secured using a non-disclosure agreement. With that being said, it is rumored that the buyout is worth an astonishing $400 million.What to make of it all?Providing his thoughts on the matter, Eric Benz, the CEO of Changelly, a crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that having known the CoinMarketCap team for many years now, he is confident that this deal will benefit both parties. In his view, the timing of the agreement for Binance couldn’t have been better, as the impact of the coronavirus is being felt across many different industries. He added:“If there was any acquisition to be made in this crypto climate, then CMC was it. Binance has done a wonderful job to make this happen and also wish them the utmost success in making this platform even better for its users. On the one hand, it might appear to be a one-sided deal, but on the other, it shows just how important crypto market data is, and this is merely the beginning of the merger and acquisition phase of crypto.”A similar outlook is shared by Mike Alfred, the CEO and co-founder of Digital Assets Data, a fintech firm, who told Cointelegraph that Binance is among the strongest and most respected companies currently operating within the crypto ecosystem, and thus it came as no surprise that they are acting decisively during a period when many firms have become quite limited in their overall operational and financial capacities. Alfred further opined:“The deal is highly strategic on multiple levels and will put Binance in an even more powerful position relative to other exchanges when BTC heads back towards all-time highs.”Will the acquisition skew CMC’s operations?Ever since the aforementioned news became mainstream, Binance has stated on several occasions that CMC will continue to operate as an independent business entity. In fact, CZ has claimed that the acquisition will not change CMC's independence from external stakeholders, suggesting that his company’s actions will not have any sort of impact on the data platform’s rankings whatsoever.However, in the short term, CMC will face minor internal restructuring, as the company’s founder and current CEO, Brandon Chez, will step down to be replaced by CMC’s current chief strategy officer, Carylyne Chan — who will serve as the interim CEO.According to David Wachsman, the founder and CEO of Wachsman, a blockchain PR firm, CMC’s new CEO, Carylyne Chan, has earned a global reputation as an executive who values transparency and fairness above all else. Moreover, from a commercial perspective, Wachsman told Cointelegraph that any skewing of results — on Binance’s behalf — would inevitably result in a deleterious effect on CMC's traffic, including the usage of the firm’s proprietary data in price oracles. Wachsman further added:“Binance’s acquisition of CoinMarketCap is a clear signal that major crypto media sites and trusted digital asset data companies –– those with strong numbers and a sticky user base –– have marketable equity value. Because of the executive team’s integrity and because the value of the CoinMarketCap property is based on trust in that data, I am convinced that CMC will stay the course as an independent organization.”Similarly, Erick Pinos, the American ecosystem lead at Ontology, a public blockchain project and distributed trust collaboration platform, told Cointelegraph that similar company acquisitions made by Binance in the past have until now continued to operate as separate entities.However, he did concede that most of these projects have ended up integrating one or more of Binance’s native offerings into their core service portfolio — Trust Wallet, for example, is a multi-token wallet that added Binance’s DEX after it was bought out by the crypto giant. Pinos further stated:“I would imagine there will be more links throughout CMC to Binance, perhaps encouraging users to sign up for Binance to trade the tokens they are looking at. If CMC’s rankings became partial to Binance, it would quickly be detected by the community. I think it’s likely that we will see Binance carry out subtle and small integrations over a longer period of time.”How does the buyout affect CMC and Binance?From a purely monetary perspective, the deal seems to make sense for CMC since the platform already has a steady revenue-generating business with its advertisements and paid API plans.Providing his technical insights on this issue, Jason Wu, the founder and CEO of DeFiner.org, a decentralized lending platform, told Cointelegraph that Binance is constantly looking for ways to penetrate the United States market. In this regard, he pointed out that in February 2020, CoinMarketCap registered 5.19 million visits from American users, which is roughly 14.1% of the company’s web traffic, while Binance only had 8% of its web traffic come from the U.S. — roughly translating to around 1.9 million web hits. He added: “Acquiring CMC will help Binance grow its U.S. user base. For CMC, this acquisition will help them grow in other regions as well.”Additionally, Wachsman believes that CoinMarketCap now has an enviable array of options when it comes to becoming increasingly commercialized. For starters, as an online advertising platform, it is still a good option for those looking to get their message across to crypto enthusiasts in a multitude of regions. Moreover, Wachsman highlighted that financial support from Binance may only increase CMC’s attractiveness as well as turn the data platform into a major generator of leads for new registrants.Lastly, enumerating the reasons why Binance went ahead and bought CMC amid such uncertain times, Piers Ridyard, the CEO of Radix DLT, a high-throughput protocol, told Cointelegraph that Binance acquired CMC primarily because of two key factors: namely customer acquisition and data flow. He added:“While Binance will increase CMC’s brand equity as much as it can over the coming years, they will do that because of the huge benefit they reap in user acquisition and better data about the whole market. Another way of thinking about it is this vs. 10 years of Google Ad spending for Binance. $40M per year in ad spending is probably substantially cheap vs. their new cost per acquisition if Binance and the CMC team keep building the CMC brand.”Furthermore, Ridyard believes that CZ has a long-term plan in mind with respect to this acquisition, and as time passes, he will most likely use this opportunity to squeeze a number of his company’s core competitors out of the market. Also, he expects to see the industry continue on its current path of consolidation, wherein cash-rich buyers will continue to “snap up good strategic plays at cheaper prices.” Ridyard closed out by saying:“The CMC acquisition is likely firstly a data play — giving Binance some massively key insights into the market beyond its own user base. Beyond that, I think that CMC’s user-facing operations will be unchanged; for exchanges, the story might shift substantially in the next couple of years.”What Lies Ahead?Even though a huge portion of the global crypto community seems to believe that this latest acquisition by Binance is a sign of the crypto industry becoming stronger, Evgen Verzun, the founder of HyperSphere.AI, a decentralized cloud, told Cointelegraph that the deal is just a mere reflection of the coronavirus-induced economic crisis that is forcing investors and businesses to find new ways to save their money.The aforementioned comment seems to be in line with recent reports that suggested that CoinMarketCap had been facing quite a few financial constraints since 2019 — even forcing the company to carry out its day-to-day operations with minimal monetary resources. For example, in October 2019, Chan stated that CMC was going to continue with its policy of “bootstrapping and scaling” in the foreseeable future."
42569, Billionaire Optimistic On Bitcoin as a ‘Flight to Safety’ ,2020-04-04t18:00:00+01:00,6211,197,"In an interview with Morgan Creek Digital founder, Anthony Pompliano, Chamath Palihapitiya, billionaire CEO of venture capital firm, Social Capital, said that now could be Bitcoin’s time to shine.“I think Bitcoin needed a moment like this for it to be relevant,” Palihapitiya said. “It’s still a speculative instrument, and it’s too speculative for it to be reliable,” he explained.Bitcoin is still too turbulentIn his interview with Pompliano, Palihapitiya talked about a bevy of topics pertaining to the current global economy. In terms of replacing USD or other global currencies, Palihapitiya explained Bitcoin is still too volatile.“The only market that’s even more important than the debt markets are the currency markets,” he said.Palihapitiya explained currency markets have a relatively low amount of volatility, moving in value over time. “In that, there’s value because it allows more market participants to be active in that market so that they can use it as a critical pillar of how they run their business,” he said.Bitcoin can’t be used in the same fashionThe billionaire said Bitcoin is immensely volatile compared to the currency markets. “You can’t effectively use it,” he posited. “It pushes it into this ghetto of day traders and speculators, and right now that’s where we are.”Palihapitiya explained that Bitcoin exits that “ghetto” by losing the day traders and speculators, while keeping some of the attraction of long-term holding.“Then you need to have it slowly look like the traditional infrastructure could really implode,” he said. Palihapitiya added that BTC could eventually be seen as a “flight to safety,” pending the likelihood of debasement in an attempt to avoid traditional framework failure.“Over the next 10 years, where this trajectory is going to take shape — and it is a 10-year trajectory — you’ll have a lot of time to vector into it to protect yourself and to hedge yourself,” Palihapitiya said, adding:“This is either zero or millions, because what it will do is it will create a quasi-gold standard. It’ll create an index, except instead of having to own gold, where gold is owned by central banks, it is an instrument that has value that’s determined by and between its participants, and it’s owned by everybody.”The crypto industry has viewed Bitcoin as a type of hedge for a number of years. Pompliano himself even lobbies for BTC as an asset uncorrelated to traditional markets.Cointelegraph reached out to Chamath Palihapitiya for additional details, but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in."
42568, Blockchain Experts Weigh in on Russia’s Controversial Coronavirus Tracking App ,2020-04-04t19:30:00+01:00,3394,118,"Experts suggest that blockchain technology could have been a better solution for handling coronavirus-related data in Russia.Moscow’s COVID-19 App is pulled from Google PlayOn March 25, an app called “Social monitoring” appeared in Google Play store. According to the app’s description, it was designed for social monitoring as well as for providing access to emergency services.Users soon noticed that the app required many sensitive permissions, including geolocation, bluetooth pairing, biometric data, and calls. Notably, the data was also being openly transmitted without encryption. The backlash against the app led to a 1-star rating on Google Play by the morning of April 1. Later that day, the app disappeared from the store altogether.Blockchain a better alternativeRussia is not the only country challenged by this crisis. Governments around the world are faced with difficult choices in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. There is a need to track people infected with the virus, but this is difficult to accomplish without compromising individual privacy and safety. In an effort to solve this dilemma, Cointelegraph investigated whether experts believe that blockchain technology could provide a workable solution.Dr. Javier Estrella, GeoDB CTO, believes that the world is just coming to realize the value of distributed trust:“The vast majority of people are just beginning to understand distributed ledger technologies and that the main advantages are not in the technical solutions, but in the approaches that lead to them. In essence, there is one feature that stands out in systems built using these technologies, distributed trust, and this is something totally new.”Furthermore, he observed that the citizens have no guarantee that collected data will not be abused or mishandled:“Who can guarantee citizens that this data will only be used to deal with the current health crisis and that the data made public by countries has not been altered?”Igor Chugunov, founder and CEO of CREDITS (CS) blockchain platform, believes:“A blockchain-based register of COVID-19 patients would present a maximally objective data which neither the patient nor the provider would be able to falsify. At the same time, cryptographically-secured decentralized data provides maximum privacy protection.”Moscow’s government giving out smartphonesMoscow’s government has not given up on the idea of using technology to keep an eye on infected inhabitants. Aleksey Shapashnikov, speaker of the Moscow parliament, said that the city is developing a database to store photos and personal information about people infected with the virus.On April 3, Moscow’s government began distributing smartphones to Muscovites with coronavirus whose symptoms are not severe enough for hospitalization. The only app that is installed on the phone is a tracking app which uses geolocation to make sure users are not leaving their homes. Those who violate the quarantine are instead hospitalized. Government servers are saving the data, which will delete the information once the pandemic is over.Remaining hurdles to considerIt may seem that blockchain and healthcare data are a match made in heaven. However, there are certain hurdles to adoptability, like legal compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S., and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. Though world governments are often resistant to innovation and decentralization, time will tell if the current crisis can alter these institutional predilections."

Voyager now reports a user base of more than 200,000 in total.Circle Invest was sold in exchange for a 4% stake in Voyager in February.Voyager onboards Circle Invest clientsVoyager offers commission-free trading on 34 crypto assets and USD.The firm will continue to offer Circle Invest’s collections feature — allowing customers to purchase baskets of assets grouped by common attributes and weighted by market cap.Users can also earn interest between 2% and 6% interest on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), the firm’s native Voyager Token (VGX), and stablecoins USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), and True USD (TUSD).Voyager is licensed as a Money Service Business with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and is publicly traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange.FinCEN mandates that Voyager must hold Circle Invest’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data for five years after account closure.Circle sheds subsidiary amid focus on stablecoinVoyager’s purchase of Circle Invest was announced in February.The news comprised the third major asset Circle has sold in 12 months — following the firm’s sale of crypto exchange, Poloniex, to investors in October 2018, and the sale of its over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, Circle Trade, to Kraken OTC in December 2019.Speaking to Cointelegraph, a Circle spokesperson indicated that the sales are part of Circle’s push to focus more on its stablecoin, USDC. They stated: “It’s clear that there’s more interest than ever before in stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, in part because significant global technology companies like Facebook and major economies like China have advanced plans for creating digital currencies.”The sales were accompanied by layoffs. Circle removed 30 positions, which accounted for 10% of its workforce, in May 2019, before culling a further 10 positions in December 2019."
42562, Talking Digital Future: Smart Cities ,2020-04-04t16:01:00+01:00,1130,72,"My journey into smart cities and their future development was a really big surprise, as the way I arrived there was not something that I had planned. I was working as the chief information officer for a company in Northern California called O'Reilly Media when I got a call from a headhunter who asked if I would consider being the chief information office for the City of Palo Alto. I can vividly remember — it was only about eight years ago — my feeling when she asked the question. The first thing that came into my mind: I would never consider working for the government. And the next quick emotion I had was: but that's really interesting and I'd like to know more.So, fortunately, my willingness to be open minded was a good thing, and I asked her to explain what the opportunity was. I think because it was the birthplace of Silicon Valley, as the city was Palo Alto, one of the things that interested me was that the city had not been notable for being technologically developed, despite being at the very heart of technological innovations. That definitely raised my curiosity.I've always been fascinated by cities and urbanism in general. I've always been interested in the political mechanisms by which cities and governments function. But these were just interests. I had no particular thought that I would ever work in that context. So, I went ahead and investigated it more. The rest is history: I accepted the opportunity.I had been focused on the city: building a team and figuring out how we could collaborate with the community and with the innovators in the area, like the big tech companies. How we could do things with them that would help us think differently about how you deliver governmental services.The idea of working as a technologist in an interesting city with the permission to try new things was very attractive to me, and I was pleased by the level of engagement. So, my thesis was right that the community and the technology companies, whether it was Hewlett-Packard, VMware or Tesla, were all interested and willing to take my call and to think about how we can apply technology and processes to change the way that city functions are done.One of my first projects with open government was to improve trust between the community and city hall. Secondly, we'd need to open up the data to all sorts of innovators to be able to produce new solutions.Other cities and other stakeholders became interested in what we were doing. Palo Alto was not on the map with regard to government innovation. Of course, everybody knew Palo Alto because of Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple: all the companies that had started there. But they never thought of Palo Alto as a place where government was run digitally.In 2011, open data was becoming a really important thing and it was just emerging. It was the time when people, governments and leaders were beginning to think about this. The Open Government Partnership was launched in September 2011 and important world leaders signed on to it. That and the United Nations were sort of a great impetus to starting to think about data, opening up data and data sets.Many governments thought that opening up their data when they did not have an obligation to do it could be risky. But my posture was different. I was of the opinion that opening data up — giving it back while protecting privacy — was an important right for humans and that it shouldn't be my decision. So, in fact, I was lucky enough to convince all the right people, including the mayor and the city manager, that we should make the data open; that we start city hall with open data by default.Having open data by default really caught on. I don't think we were the first, but we were certainly among the first five in the world to approach it this way. So, I really wanted to share with you that story of how I found my way into a city. My intention was to be very local and focused, which I continue to do, but there were a number of triggers that elevated what we were doing. As a consequence, I would go to these conferences to speak and would meet other people. I got deeper and deeper into this emerging smart city movement where eventually, after a few years, I was considered — and I'm still considered — one of the top 20 thought leaders on this topic. And of course, I still write about it, I still talk about it and I still consult in this area. And now I am working on my book, Smart Cities for Dummies, which will come out in 2020.I really believe that this sort of movement — whatever we call it, we can use the term smart city — today is really at the beginning. We're just getting started. I'll just give you one data point and then we can go to your next question. In the United States alone, there are 90,000 cities, towns and associated government agencies. That's 90,000. I could tell you very quickly 20 cities that are doing interesting things. I could maybe push further and name you 50. So, let's say I know 50 cities. Maybe somebody else can give you another list of 200 or 500. Even if they could give you 1,000, that’s still only a tiny percentage of government agencies just in America that are doing something in the space. It's gonna take a good few more years before we see this being mainstream and having real substantive momentum, for it to be more widely adopted, and for us to see real action happen and real innovation.Defining “smartness”Let's focus on the definitions of this concept. The keywords here are smart, information and digital technologies. I think that the term smart city in particular is definitely fluid, and I would probably be an advocate for a better way to describe this in the future. I actually am a very big fan of urban innovation, but I'm not sure it has meaning. It's meaningful enough to some people, but we'll see. The term smart got popular. It's definitely a strong marketing term, and you're beginning to see smart cities, smart nations, smart factories and smart hospitals. It's becoming quite used in lots of contexts. I would say the best definition would be the one that is super focused on the use of technology to innovate and advance a subject.I've recently been writing about the digital twin concept, and a big part of the concept exists in factories. So, you have a digital replica of a physical object, and you can use the digital replica for consuming data from a machine. Then you could figure out if the machine is going to break or not, or if we need to replace parts. And as you digitize these factories, which is happening quite rapidly — you've got the term industry 4.0 that comes out of Germany, where we're increasingly using the term smart and where we're moving from factories to smart factories as we digitize them. Same thing in hospitals as we use more and more technology. We're using technology for more personalized medicine, more personalized treatment plans, and we're calling it smart medicine or smart hospitals.The term smart cities effectively means a lot. We're using technology for improving liveability, workability and sustainability. These are the sort of three big categories. I think digital is a very big part of this. You know, digital has a much bigger meaning than just the notion of ones and zeros, really. The kind of movement from analog to binary — in many ways digital now means style. It means behavior. It means business models. I’m just thinking as we work through the answer to this question.Maybe digital is more controversial and even broader than the term smart as we think about the future of cities because a digital city doesn't necessarily just mean cities as connected devices and websites. It means the city’s style and approach to how it delivers is rooted in innovation and in the use of contemporary and emerging technologies. I think with smart cities or digital cities, the terms smart and digital are used interchangeably.Digital transformation or revolution?The neat thing about digital is the broad application across all sectors of society. We speak of this idea of digital transformation, which effectively means: Is your business or organization ready for the needs of the 21st century, or at least the first half of the 21st century?And so, cities are certainly going through digital transformations, but there isn't so much of a transformation as there is a revolution. I speak about this idea of the fourth Industrial Revolution as: we are not just shifting conservatively from one state to another, but we are going through a big and dramatic change. And it is not only the change of technology and how we work and travel, but it's about how we think. It's about our political systems. It's about our philosophy on how everybody gets compensated. It's about thinking about things like universal basic income. We are going through this remarkable revolution where everything is changing, not just one part of society or one part of what it means to be a human.Cities of the future: transportationWhen we think about future cities, it's fair to say that we are in the beginning stages of a revolution. That means that things will look very, very different.To really be called a smart city, there are areas where the implementation of technological innovation is the most urgent, ambitious and important. The first I would mention is transportation. There has probably never been a time when transportation has been entirely effective, particularly in a city context, but it's been better than it is today. It is getting a lot, lot worse.You do not need to be a scientist or a specialist to just go to any major city in the world and recognize quickly that transportation is fundamentally broken. Whether it's public transportation or cars, which are such a big part of modern life in our modern cities and in many developing areas of the world where cities are growing very rapidly.Modern cities face this problem not because people are not qualified or there are no available jobs, but simply because they can't get to them. It's so difficult to go from where they live to where the factories or their places of work are. It would take them hours to get there, and it comes down to something as basic as that. We need better ways of getting people to their places of employment, or we need to rethink where people live and how they live. But the car problem is very painful as it is not only a problem of congestion and slow movement, but it's also about mental health and environmental health.Here in the United States, every major city has significant transportation issues in the morning and the evening when people go to work and when they come home from work. And here in Silicon Valley where I live, people are commuting an hour and a half or more each way. So, people are spending three to four hours in a car every single day. That can't be good for themselves or their lives, and it can't be good for the planet with all that carbon being spewed out.Many communities have very nice public transit. London has a very good underground system, they have buses and they seem to have developed a comprehensive public transportation system. Paris does. Moscow does. Other major cities around the world have very good public transit, but it's under duress. It's aging, and it was built for populations that were much smaller than they are today. And of course, our populations are growing. There is some good movement in this area toward, for example, more cycling. The Netherlands is a great model for other communities to look at and say, “What kind of a life do you create when lots of people have access to bicycles? What kind of infrastructure do you need to support that?” I mean, it's really fascinating to be in Amsterdam, Utrecht or different areas of the country. As a person who's in a society that doesn't have as much bike utilization, the degree to which everybody's on their bike is quite remarkable.Our movement toward using more electric vehicles is a very positive notion: finally seeing the end of the combustion engine. There are some very ambitious goals around the world to sell the last combustion engine.In Scandinavia, it's in the 2035 time period. In England, it's 2045. India is 2045. So, we can see we'll be seeing a great transformation there. You've also got autonomous vehicles, which are making great progress but with some ways to go. It does seem to me, based on my research, that we are going to see widespread vehicles driving themselves over the next few decades.So, cities that have elaborated ambitious transportation plans and activities are probably playing into the smart term a little more than others. If you have this creative, ambitious and urgent set of goals to transform the transportation of your community, I would say that's a big part of being a smart community today.I worry sometimes, though, that it's not big enough; that the ambition is not big enough. I love when I hear about cities looking at Hyperloop. It at first seems like a crazy idea, but so does every great idea. Suddenly communities are really thinking about how to approach something like Hyperloop and thinking completely differently about moving people and goods. Transportation would probably be up there in terms of one of the areas that is most active around the world in the smart city movement. You'll see lots and lots of different initiatives in lots of different domains, but if you look at the big ones and the ones that are actually happening that are urgent, ambitious and important, I would say transportation is up there.Cities of the future: energyThe second deep dive would be energy. You know, it's fascinating to think about some of the crises that the planet has faced over the last 100 years. At one point we thought we'd run out of food. Well, today we make more food than the world needs. We had a hole in the ozone. We thought it would be very destructive, but we found a way to fix the ozone. We also thought we would not have enough energy, and today we produce enormous amounts of low-cost energy around the world. But it's still not great energy.Carbon energy, whether you're fueling up with electricity or gasoline, is not only bad for the planet because you have beat the Earth to excavate it out of mountains and caves, but it is terrible for the environment and is heating up the Earth. So, we need to find a way to move quickly to alternatives that are abundant, but also better for the environment.I think the movement toward solar and wind is rapidly becoming part of the smart city movement. Solar is really making excellent progress at domestic, house and industrial levels. Communities that are super focused on migrating away from gas and coal to green energy have begun to meet the characteristics of a smart city.The climate crisis is happening in cities and it will be largely solved in cities. So, a smart city is one that operates sustainably. It's a city that is focused on activities that protect its citizens and its infrastructure from extreme weather events and from rising water.For example, last summer saw the hottest temperatures we've ever seen in many cities, and it's having repercussions. People are dying, and there's also all sorts of other problems, such as airplanes not being able to take off because the runways are too hot and may melt plane tires.The smart city is dealing with a climate crisis. This is such a big topic, but it's got to be part of a smart city strategy. And I would again say it's urgent, needs ambition and is very important.Cities of the future: digitalizationThe third one would be digital transformation. The fact is that most community members would much rather use their iPhone or Android smartphone to engage with the government than going to a building and spending two hours working with a government official.We have to move the most common processes to a digital format and make them available through web browsers and mobile applications. The good news story is that lots of communities are doing this. But I would caution one thing: it's not just about the technology. You have to put in place the culture processes and the right skills to be able to do it right. You never get the results you want by simply deploying technology.Cities of the future: blockchainBlockchain technology is certainly emerging, and it’s emerging as fundamental to the back-end technology that's enabling things that weren’t possible before and helping to improve security and trust in transactions. And it's happening at different rates in different industries. So, you find blockchain, of course, in the financial sector. You see it in the healthcare sector, supply chain and manufacturing, and you see it in the city and government arena.Each of these different domains, along with others, are experimenting. Some are implementing different things, but they're all at different levels. In fact, just like any database, the application of blockchain is extremely varied.It doesn't just get you one particular solution. I think blockchain presents a lot of fascinating opportunities for government. The first one that I think is very well worth exploring and seeing where it takes us is identity management. So, you take something as rudimentary — in terms of its importance in our society, I suppose — as voting.Today, in many cities we go to a place. We go to a polling station and we may use electronic systems, but we also may use a piece of paper or something, so voting is very manual and often very analog. Also, we have concerns about the legitimacy of our votes. Are they counted? Are they being faked? Are people who are voting allowed to vote? These are really core questions here.So, electronic voting is very compelling if we can get it right. It has happened in a couple of communities, but that's not enough for the solution to work on a broad basis around the world. We need to figure this out.There are many different iterations of this kind of thinking regarding how we might be able to improve voting and not only prove it in terms of integrity, but make it accessible from a smartphone so that I don't have to mail in my vote or go to the polling booth.The thing, of course, is authentication across city services. I live here in a place called Foster City. As a member of the community, maybe one day I want to go to the city library, and then another day I want to pay a parking ticket, and maybe another day I want to reserve a room in a community center. Each time I do that, I'm probably going to work with a different system, and it doesn't know who I am each time. So, I have a unique login name, and I have a unique password. I have to give my credentials each time. But the fact is that I'm the same person interacting with the same government. So, it will be very valuable to have the ability for community members to be authenticated across city services.In both the voting world and in this sort of ID verification of an individual and a community, blockchain is beginning to be an interesting way we might achieve that. I think there's some time to go and now it's not widespread other than maybe in Zug, Switzerland, and in Estonia. Beyond that, we don't see the broad use of the technology yet in this context, but we're seeing fantastic exploration. It could be that within a short amount of time we will begin to see the first development of blockchain-based ID systems.I think the other one I would just mention in blockchain, then I'll talk about crypto in a second, is that what governments do most commonly anywhere in the world is store information about societies. They have great repositories of societal history, whether it's birth certificates, death certificates, property deeds or contracts. They have all sorts of historical documents, declarations and legislation.During the 2000s, in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, there unfortunately was a direct hit from a hurricane. The biggest thing wasn't so much the damage from the wind, rather it was the damage from the water that was created. It created a lot of rain and a lot of flooding. The city of New Orleans was completely and utterly flooded. It was a disaster. Unfortunately, it also flooded a lot of government buildings, and in those government buildings — particularly in the basements — were lots and lots of historical documents belonging to the city of New Orleans. And while it's not spoken about a lot, all those documents were lost because once they're underwater for a few days, the paper just disintegrates and the ink comes off.So, one of the big challenges for New Orleans since that big hurricane has been to replicate, recover and regenerate a lot of documentation. In cities all over the world, unfortunately, there's still a high volume of content that is stored on paper.It is not just about the risk of being destroyed by a natural disaster, water or fire, but about the ability to search against that information and the challenges of it maybe being lost or people modifying it. It's enormously problematic. And yeah, sure, we can just put it in a database, and we should. In some places, such as Palo Alto, we are doing it: scanning and digitizing all of our paper documentation.Blockchain as an alternative database can be very valuable in that context because of its immutability and its provenance. If a property deed is stored in a blockchain database, while property deeds move from person to person over time, we're able to easily trace the entire history of that document back to its first creation. Blockchain does this really, really well. So, I think I'm seeing some evidence, and there's some good examples already, of blockchain being used for document management in the context of cities and governments. You know, I've said many things just scratching the surface here, but those are two massive opportunities for blockchain technology.Cities of the future: cryptocurrencyI think the question of crypto is fascinating and largely unknown. I mean, at some basic level, if a cryptocurrency does become mainstream, of course it has implications for governments. It means thinking about protections. It means thinking about support for it.What happens to the financial community and the banking activities of governments? I think crypto sort of has some fundamental possibilities that can be quite disruptive. There will be significant consequences in cities, and in governments more generally, if society begins to more broadly embrace the notion of a reliable, trusted cryptocurrency.The city with the biggest potential of becoming a smart cityOne of the things that I'd like to note is that a smart city is very local. It's very specific to each community. Smartness in Rio de Janeiro means something different than smartness in southeast Italy, in Melbourne, Australia, or in Palo Alto, California. It really reflects the needs of the community.Africa is emerging as an incredible continent. The countries of Africa and the cities of Africa are emerging at different levels. They will need to build and deliver to their people as they emerge rapidly, consistent with what's important to them and not what's important to California, Italy or Australia. I can say that Estonia is doing some pretty amazing things. It's used often as an example, of course, and it's not always the best example because it's so small. The big cities of the world have 20 million to 25 million people, while the whole country of Estonia has 1.5 million. So, it's not always a great example, but it gives us a clue about where things are headed. Of course, the tiny little city of Zug in Switzerland is definitely a smart crypto city, but it's tiny. I think there's just thousands of people. A small city, but it's smart. It's simpler to be smart when you are small.It's actually easier to do a lot of things when you're a small city. The bigger you get, the harder it is, that's for sure. But if you think about Mexico with over 25 million people, when you do something important there, it really is a big deal.This is part three of a multi-part series on digital future and technological innovations.

A clean break above the resistance of $6,900-7,100 would indicate bullish momentum, which opens the door to $8K.BTC USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe reasoning behind this thought is quite clear. Bitcoin has seen a massive retracement in the past few weeks, after which the price slowly started to move up, as it’s up almost 100% since the recent low of $3,750.However, no level has been claimed for support again, which is a crucial ingredient in becoming bullish. The price of Bitcoin needs to claim old support levels to flip levels from resistance to support and to generate a further optimistic outlook for the market.Price of Bitcoin also fighting 100-Week MABLX 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe higher time frame charts are the charts to watch at this point, as they provide massive support and resistance levels.The weekly chart is one of those charts, as the 100, 200 and 300-moving averages show significant support and resistance levels.Currently, the price of Bitcoin bounced from the 300-Week MA, closed above the 200-Week MA, and rejected at the 100-Week MA. The latter, the 100-Week MA, is a crucial factor to watch for if the market wants to turn bull.An apparent breakthrough of the $6,900 level (as that’s the level around the 100-Week MA) would mean that the market regains this moving average as support. A conclusion can be drawn that a bull market has started if that moving average can become support.However, losing the 200-Week MA (which is around $5,400), would generally lead to a further drop to the $4,000 area, which is around the 300-Week MA. Such a drop would inevitably result in a period of accumulation as witnessed in previous cycles.An accumulation and sideways period wouldn’t be strange in the current economic climate surrounding the coronavirus. However, if Bitcoin can reclaim the 100-Week MA and turn bullish, then that would be a major bull market signal.Total market capitalization also fighting crucial resistanceTotal market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is showing a clear view. A break and a close above the $185-190 billion resistance level would suggest a bull market and put the $240 and $300 billion resistance levels in sight.However, if the market goes into the red next week, a further downwards test could also occur in the total market capitalization chart.The levels to watch for are the $130 and $105-115 billion regions. As discussed previously in the article, the 300-Week MA could serve as major support.This moving average is lying around $117 billion as we speak, confluent with the support levels lying beneath the markets. If the market decides to fall further, this level is the primary area to look for.The bullish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD 6-hour bullish chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario for Bitcoin is now pretty straightforward. The chart is showing a clear downwards pointing trendline, which needs to be broken to the upside for a bullish outlook.Therefore, Bitcoin has to remain above $6,300-6,400 for support as the first step, after which the next massive step would be to generate a breakout to the upside.The moment that Bitcoin decides to break through the $6,900-7,100 resistance level, a green $700-1,000 candle may be expected, as it’s pretty much open-air until the major next resistance level at $7,800-8,000.The final step for a massively bullish outlook would be to flip the $6,900-7,100 for support. If that happens, further upwards momentum can be expected with targets at $8,500, $9,300 and $10,400 after that.For now, a breakout above the current resistance level would be a great signal.The bearish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD 6-hour bearish chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish outlook is still likely given the current economic instabilities and Bitcoin price trend, which can be said is in a rising wedge within a general downtrend.Given that the volume is decreasing in the recent movements, a big move is to be expected from the markets. Combining everything alongside the resistances, a downwards move is the most likely to occur.Therefore, if the price of Bitcoin can’t break above $6,900-7,100 (red zone), a drop towards $5,600-5,800 is to be expected. The movements to watch for traders then are the support/resistance flips in continuation.If the price of Bitcoin drops to $5,600 and the bounce gets rejected instantly at $6,300, then further downward momentum should be expected.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42556, Bitfinex Supplied ‘Most’ Liquidity During $3.7K Bitcoin Crash — Report ,2020-04-04t14:11:00+01:00,3635,95,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw a “flippening” during its price crash to $3,700 last month — something that could reveal a new uncomfortable truth about exchanges.In its March Exchange Review released this week, monitoring resource CryptoCompare highlighted liquidity as a key metric which changed during last month’s extreme volatility.CryptoCompare: Bitfinex hit 40% of exchange volumeOn March 12, as Bitcoin prices collapsed in a matter of hours, it was notably one platform in particular which provided more volume, and hence liquidity, for traders.“Despite Binance and OKEx trading the most volume across all markets in broad terms, during the exact moment of the BTC crash (approx. 10:30 am GMT) which began on the 12th, it was Bitfinex that represented the majority of Top-Tier exchange trading volume (across BTC/USD and BTC/USDT markets),” the review states.“This was followed by Coinbase, OKEx and Bitstamp who also maintained high volumes during this time.”Bitcoin exchange volume for March 12, 2020. Source: CryptoCompareAccording to CryptoCompare, the first hour of the precipitous crash saw Bitfinex provide the most volume.Among top-tier exchanges excluding Coinbase, OKEx and Bitstamp, “between 10:40 am and 11 am, it represented 40% of volume on average among these exchanges,” the report continued.During the brief period, Bitfinex was handling up to $11.8 million worth of trades per minute.Bitcoin whale praises platformReacting to the findings, online commentators were quick to point out that more “mainstream” exchanges with ubiquitous branding were unable to compete with the more modest Bitfinex in terms of liquidity.Among them was the Twitter user J0e007, a notorious high-volume Bitcoin trader who regularly tops the list of highest-grossing Bitfinex accounts.“When shit hits the fan, you know where you can get real liquidity,” he wrote in a post on Saturday.“It's definitely not on those faketown exchanges with such great marketing headed by popular figureheads.”CryptoCompare also noted that March 13 saw the highest volumes in history on cryptocurrency markets, with $75.9 billion in a single day.Derivatives giant BitMEX continues to field criticism over its potential role in the crash, despite executives denying that the platform’s technical problems were to blame.On Saturday, fellow high-volume trader Hsaka warned of unpredictable volatility on BitMEX’s futures markets, after a spike of $450 during trading, which lasted just one minute."

42554, Blockchain Provides Trusted Data to Counter Spread of Coronavirus ,2020-04-04t12:50:00+01:00,1740,129,"With each passing day, new data regarding the coronavirus pandemic is being brought to the public’s attention. From the number of cases in various regions to ever-changing safety procedures like wearing masks in public, COVID-19 data is clearly present, yet remains inconsistent.While a lack of accurate information may be frustrating on a personal level, ever-changing data is taking a toll on the health officials and researchers working effortlessly to help subdue the coronavirus crisis. To combat the issue, the San Francisco-based blockchain security company Hacera launched a data analytics platform in February to combat inaccurate COVID-19 data.Hacrera’s founder, Jonathan Levi, told Cointelegraph that the platform known as MiPasa is a distributed and verifiable data hub that is being used to collect, validate and leverage COVID-19 data, saying:“MiPasa is using data in an effective, humane and privacy-respecting way. At its heart, MiPasa is based on blockchain technology and was designed to support governments, municipalities, application builders and individuals alike.”According to Levi, one of the main problems faced by clinicians, scientists and researchers studying data behind the crisis is a lack of integration of verified sources. As coronavirus cases around the world have surpassed 1 million, verifiable and trusted data is more important than ever before to help curb the crisis.Understanding MiPasaMiPasa partners with Oracle and Microsoft to utilize data analytics to synthesize COVID-19 data sources. Technology giant IBM recently announced that its blockchain platform will also support MiPasa. Jerry Cuomo, the vice president of IBM Blockchain, told Cointelegraph that MiPasa is an effective tool to help solve the lack of integrated, verified data sources around the coronavirus.Cuomo further explained that the platform works to address inconsistencies and identify errors or misreporting before seamlessly integrating credible new data feeds. As a result, health officials can quickly respond and devise solutions that can help subdue the outbreak or support recovery from the coronavirus.Cuomo added that MiPasa is gathering information from institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, the Israeli Ministry of Health, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization in order to determine hot spots, information on individuals and state authorities, health institutions and more. Once data is collected, the platform makes sure the information is accurate. Cuomo said:“MiPasa ensures that new data entered into the system matches the original. Finally, a third level of validation comes from the public, who could report inconsistencies or bad data, giving public health officials a way to analyze and respond to public sentiment.”As more technology partners bring analytics into MiPasa, new data streams can be provided, which will enhance the platform’s value, as explained by Cuomo, MiPasa is looking to provide not only raw data but also observations from that data, adding: “We are currently bringing in analytic tools like IBM Watson to help with this.”Blockchain ensures private, trusted data on MiPasaWhile accurate data from different sources could greatly help subdue the coronavirus pandemic, Cuomo mentioned that it’s been challenging to onboard new data sources to the MiPasa platform because of data privacy concerns, as companies remain hesitant to share sensitive data on an open network.Unlike a traditional database with a single network administrator, MiPasa is built as a multi-cloud solution. Some components are deployed on the IBM Cloud, through the IBM Blockchain Platform; Oracle's Blockchain Platform; Microsoft Azure and other core enablers. All of these components are connected through the Unbounded Network, powered by Hyperledger Fabric.Levi noted that due to data export restrictions in certain regions, much thought is being given to understand what type of data will be stored on the immutable, shared blockchain ledgers. “There may be more than one ledger underlying MiPasa's architecture.” Levi further hinted.According to Cuomo, the real benefit of using blockchain in conjunction with MiPasa is that it provides trustworthy data. He explained that blockchain allows for multiple administrators to collaborate over the validity of ever changing data.“When data is coming from Johns Hopkins, for example, we can quickly verify the information is truly from that organization, since multiple companies like Oracle, Microsoft and IBM collaborate to validate that data.”Privacy plays a key role in getting organizations on board to share their data on MiPasa. While this ensures data can easily be shared across a network of different organizations, it also guarantees privacy.While MiPasa works to combine, ageragate and bring together public data, personally identifiable information is never shared. The platform supports decentralized identifiers to encode personal information. Levi also noted that Hacera leverages a product known as Private-sea, which is based on zero-knowledge proofs, which use cryptography to allow data to be shared between different entities without revealing sensitive information.Cuomo pointed out that it's important for organizations to understand the privacy measures behind MiPasa, as the platform thrives on data, adding, “MiPasa is a data hub, therefore its utility is a function of the data sources that it contains.”A MiPasa mobile app could come nextAlthough MiPasa is catering primarily to researchers and health officials, Levi noted that the platform is designed to help the public as well. He mentioned that Hacera is currently working on integrating data from mobile applications, along with navigating privacy and regulation restrictions, as a mobile consumer facing application could come next. For now though, Levi remains focused on the development of MiPasa and gathering relevant data.“Like everyone else, we have been following the development of the coronavirus crisis with growing concern. In February, we took a deep-dive into the data and were amazed by the inconsistencies, gaps, and sheer lack of reliable information between different sources and entities. It quickly became very clear that no solution for the containment or treatment of COVID-19 can be developed using the existing data sets, so we are working hard to change this by leveraging blockchain and other technologies.”"

Source: TradingViewTechnical analysts say that the declining volume of Bitcoin put together with stagnant open interest in futures and the abrupt V-shape recovery of the cryptocurrency market increase the likelihood of the Bitcoin price falling in the near-term.Elliot Wave, larger triangle & declining volume raises chances of a new Bitcoin bottomA pseudonymous trader who called the $3,000 bottom of Bitcoin in December 2018 said that the current price action of BTC can be analyzed as either an Elliot Wave, a larger triangle, or a “larger flat.”All three indicators suggest a short-term corrective pattern, given the lackluster volume in both futures and spot exchange markets.The recent price trend of Bitcoin also closely resembles a Wyckoff Events and Phases pattern, which when played out could result in a retest of the low $4,000 region.The trader said:“There's so many different ways you could count btc here. either wxy, larger triangle, larger flat, I’m not too sure, the one thing that does stick out is the series of 3 wave moves and lack of 5 wave motives. for this reason I think it’s still too early to call a bottom.”The Elliott Wave pattern often divides traders on its practicality in evaluating price trends of cryptocurrencies, as it can be used to support both bullish and bearish scenarios.Bullish and Bearish Elliot Wave Patterns. Source: dailyfx.comHence, when technical analysts typically spot an Elliot Wave pattern forming on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, they evaluate other key technical data such as the daily volume of spot exchanges.Spot volume is a crucial indicator of actual demand from retail traders in the cryptocurrency market for Bitcoin. Unlike highly leveraged volume on futures exchanges, spot volume on major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and Bitstamp provides insight into the retail market.Why stagnant spot volume of BTC is an important piece of data to considerThe Bitcoin price doubled since dropping to as low as $3,600 on futures exchanges and $4,000 on spot exchanges on March 12, when it peaked at $7,300 earlier this week.For an asset that saw a 100% increase in price, the spot volume of Bitcoin has remained relatively stagnant, unable to rebound to mid-March levels.Data from Skew shows that the spot volume of Bitcoin rose to as high as $1 billion on March 12, but has since dropped to below $250 million.Bitcoin spot volume.

42548, EU Highlights Blockchain Benefits in Digitization Write-Up ,2020-04-04t06:00:00+01:00,2862,120,"The European Union, or EU, mentioned blockchain technology as part of social services digitization efforts to keep Europe up to speed with the changing times.“As in the case of the services sector, the use of blockchain technology is in an early phase of adoption in health and social care, where it has been used to pay benefits in cash and to monitor pension contributions,” the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, or Eurofound, an EU agency, said in a 2020 report.The EU agency sees blockchain benefits and use casesHighlighting the technology’s benefits, the report noted blockchain enables security, absent third-party reliance.“Other possible benefits from this technology for the public sector are more tailored services for citizens and greater transparency and trust in governments,” the write-up noted. “Identification via blockchain can be used to allocate funding and benefits in cash in a more time- and cost-efficient manner.”The report also highlighted other blockchain usages, including those relating to pensions and payments.Additionally, Eurofound pointed toward blockchain’s importance, even given the technology’s youth. “Even though blockchain is still in the early stages of adoption in the service sector, it may lead to the replacement of intermediaries, contracts and/or verification systems,” the agency detailed.The report as a whole aims to go digitalIn addition to blockchain, the report mentioned many areas of digitization, including artificial intelligence, robots, and Internet of Things technology.“Often, the objectives of the digitalization of social services are to achieve cost efficiency and to allow older people to live in their own homes independently for as long as possible,” Eurofound said of its digitization effort as a whole.The EU report said parties researched and composed the report prior to the global coronavirus situation at hand, although pertinent aspects have also been added regarding the ordeal.Since Bitcoin’s price peak and mainstream hype in 2017, more and more entities have dived down the blockchain rabbit hole, exploring the technology made famous for underpinning crypto’s largest asset.

42545, General Motors Files Patent for a Blockchain-Based Navigation Map ,2020-04-04t04:00:00+01:00,7938,210,"Major car manufacturer, General Motors, or GM, has filed a patent application for a continuously updating navigation map system. The system would use blockchain to integrate data from vehicle sensors and build a reliable map for autonomous vehicles.According to the filing, which was submitted on Oct. 1, 2018 and published on April 2, 2020, existing maps are “difficult to keep dynamic without incurring large costs.”One potential reason for this is that most maps are maintained through specialized vehicles, whose reach will necessarily be limited to just a few specific sections of the world.General Motors’ solution is to distribute the process to many vehicles, which would collect data about their surroundings through sensors as they simply drive around.The real-time data would be compared with a discrepancy detector, which analyzes the existing maps.Any difference is transmitted to a blockchain network that holds all the map data. The “candidate transaction” is then validated if other vehicles report a similar change. The patent suggests that the network would be maintained by vehicles and mining nodes located in data centers.The system was likely developed for GM’s “Super Cruise” feature, which provides a semi-automated driving experience on some luxury models. Unlike competitors from Tesla, the system relies very heavily on navigation maps, which is why it can only be used on “supported” roads.Distributing the map generation process would likely speed up the manufacturer’s efforts to cover the majority of the roads in the U.S.The patent reveals that one of the benefits of the system is distributing the map generation process and allowing multiple vendors to contribute to a single map. This is likely the reason why it implements blockchain.Automotive industry and blockchainAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, General Motors is one of the more prolific car manufacturers in the blockchain sector. In October 2019, it was one of the five car manufacturers testing a blockchain-based payment and identification system for vehicles.Its finance arm invested into a blockchain startup in June, in an effort to curb auto financing fraud.The manufacturer also patented another blockchain-based communication system in December 2018, which would help different entities communicate with autonomous cars."
42542," Coinbase-Backed Crypto Rating Council Lists IOTA, BAT, and USDC ",2020-04-04t02:00:00+01:00,5594,150,"The question of whether certain cryptocurrencies constitute securities is becoming increasingly relevant within the blockchain industry. As such, some core players in the space are upping their efforts to bring more understanding to the issue.The Crypto Rating Council, or CRC, is a group of major United States’ crypto firms that advocates and promotes regulatory clarity in crypto. Recently, the CRC evaluated a number of new cryptocurrencies to determine whether they should show signs of being securities.Three new tokens are analyzedIn an April 2 blog post, the CRC published an introduction to ratings for three new cryptocurrencies including Basic Attention Token (BAT), USDCoin (USDC), and Iota (IOTA). In the post, the CRC noted that it periodically reviews previously published scores based on new developments, as well as an understanding of available facts. As such, the council has also updated scores for Maker (MKR) and Polymath (POLY), the announcement reads.As previously reported, CRC’s asset ratings tool ranks digital assets on a scale of 1 to 5, where the highest score means that a certain token is likely considered a security that cannot be issued, sold, or traded by unregulated firms. The CRC’s analysis is not endorsed by developer teams, regulators, or any other third party.IOTA is unlikely to be considered a securityAccording to the CRC’s asset ratings page, IOTA’s token, which scored a 2.00, is not likely to be viewed as a security. IOTA is one of the top-30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.In a subsequent blog post, IOTA outlined that the rating will help the project gain more credibility in the U.S. market, stating:“With our Crypto Ratings Council rating, we believe the US market and CRC’s partner organizations will feel more comfortable and confident engaging with the IOTA token and protocol.”Stablecoins scored 1.00Similarly, Basic Attention Token, an Ethereum token that powers Brave’s blockchain-based digital advertising platform, also scored a 2.00.USDCoin, a major stablecoin project backed by major crypto companies like Coinbase and Circle, is ranked at 1.00. This indicates that the token should not be considered a security. USDC is not the only U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin defined in the CRC’s asset ratings list. Dai (DAI), another stablecoin project, scored an identical 1.00.Cointelegraph reached out to the firms behind the newly listed tokens for additional queries and will update if we hear back.Crypto Rating Council is unlikely to change the opinion of regulatory groupsEstablished in September 2019, the CRC is a collaboration of major crypto firms including popular U.S. crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, and others. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, some industry experts believe that the CRC’s determinations are unlikely to impact the official opinions of securities regulators.XRP, the third biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is facing a long-running lawsuit which claims that the coin is a security. Cointelegraph reported that XRP was considered by the CRC to likely be a security back in 2019. According to the council, the coin still maintains a 4.00 ranking as of press time."
42540, Coronavirus & Bitcoin Price: Is China Losing Its BTC Mining Monopoly? ,2020-04-04t00:40:00+01:00,10735,134,"This week the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged more than 15%, reaching a high at $7,200 before pulling back into the $6,800 range. Despite the recovery, Bitcoin still has a way to go in order to reach the $8,000 level seen before the coronavirus-triggered selloff on March 12.Cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360The drop had several consequences on the Bitcoin network. Having reached the $3,800 price range, the accentuated drop forced some Bitcoin miners to throw in the towel and shut down their operations due to mining becoming unprofitable.As miners have hosting and electricity fees to keep up with, often relying on the short-term yields of their equipment, the price led to the biggest difficulty drop since 2011. However, it seems like the coronavirus and the steep drop in the value of Bitcoin may have affected some regions more than others.Chinese miners go darkAs was recently reported by the Chinese publication Securities Daily, more than 40 established mining operations have been forced to shut down as a large number of Antminer S9s, an older generation of Bitmain’s popular Antminer products, have become unprofitable. An industry insider told the publication that “roughly 2.3 million Antminer S9s have been shut down since March 10,” according to data from F2pool.This drop in the price of BTC seems to have affected Chinese miners the most due to the amount of S9s and old-generation equipment that have become unprofitable to keep using. Electricity prices for miners in China range from $0.03 to $0.05 per kilowatt-hour. Even for miners with electricity at median rates of $0.04 per kWh, miners need Bitcoin to be at $5,136 to be profitable.Matt D’Souza, the CEO of Blockware Solutions, told Cointelegraph:“The drop was several old generation rigs going unprofitable. If you monitor the pools. Many of the Asian pools lost hash, not the American pools. That signals it were machines in the East that shut down, not North America. It was old gen equipment out East. It was ultimately the price of Bitcoin dropping and machines becoming unprofitable and forced to shut off.”Impact of coronavirus on China-based minersNot only has coronavirus affected miners indirectly through its effect on the price of Bitcoin — and just about every other asset class — the pandemic has also affected the area more broadly and made machines harder to come by as supply chains have been disrupted. D’Souza explained:“I think COVID has influenced hash rate drop because it has disrupted global supply chains. So miners are not getting rigs quick enough. The difficulty adjustment was much greater because next-gen rigs have been delayed due to COVID-19.”The pandemic has also had a considerable effect on the secondhand market for mining equipment, which has always been a well-known subset of the mining industry. Wu Tong, the deputy director of the Blockchain Commission within China’s Ministry of Commerce, has already observed this first hand. He recently told Securities Daily:""Under the influence of the epidemic, the difficulty of maintaining, renewing and continuing production of mining machines has further increased, and the 12.04 price plunge has put many mining machines on sale. The tide of mining machine selling has already occurred, and the average selling price of each mining machine is 30%–50% lower than before the Spring Festival.""Why miners may move away from ChinaChina has been the market leader when it comes to mining for a long time, with studies showing it collectively controls a majority of the Bitcoin hash rate. China’s dominance is owed mainly to the country’s low electricity prices and leading manufacturers, such as Bitmain and Ebang.These conditions not only allow more advanced Bitcoin mining operations to access new generation equipment quickly and cheaply but also for smaller operations to make use of old equipment for longer and acquire it at lower prices.However, as Bitcoin continues to mature and gain interest among investors, other countries may have a different set of characteristics that make it more viable for mining.Pros and cons of mining in the EastCountries like Venezuela that have even cheaper electricity and other subsidized energy sources often end up receiving old mining equipment like the aforementioned Antminer S9. But the price is not the only factor, as internet speeds also give countries like the United States an edge.Higher purchasing power and the ability to raise capital may allow new miners in Western countries to access new-generation machines and to stay ahead of the curve. This is the case with Blockware Mining, which has kept its 180 petahash per second mining operation up and going despite higher electricity prices in the U.S.Moreover, the Chinese government has not shied away from its dislike of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin mining. The country has a track record of cracking down extensively on exchanges and many illegal mining operations. The U.S., on the other hand, has been ahead of the curve when it comes to regulating the cryptocurrency industry, which may prove to be a decisive factor in the future.It has certainly proven to be so for companies like Bitmain and Ebang, which have submitted listing applications to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange but have not heard back.A pivotal moment for miningOverall, it’s possible that we may see a shift in the mining industry, especially with moments like the halving and the ongoing pandemic.The hypothetical decentralization of the industry would be welcome, as many have expressed concerns when it comes to the centralization of Bitcoin mining. But for now, China continues to take the lead.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42539, BRI Remittance Brings Digital Identity to Banking With Blockchain Partnership ,2020-04-03t23:55:00+01:00,2789,165,"Digital identity solutions are on the rise as consumers seek security and accessibility in a digitized world. A new report from 360iResearch shows that the global digital identity market is expected to have reached about $37 Million by the end of 2025. As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc, this number could grow even larger.Unsurprisingly, the trillion-dollar banking industry has already expressed interest in digital identity solutions. For example, Everest, a blockchain-based digital payments provider, has recently formed a partnership with BRI Remittance, a subsidiary of one of Indonesia’s largest banks. Everest has been collaborating with BRI to offer bank users a blockchain-based digital commerce platform that will allow Indonesians and Europeans to easily exchange value across international borders.Bob Reid, the CEO and co-founder of Everest, told Cointelegraph that BRI Remittance’s digital commerce platform is already being implemented and will officially launch in the second quarter of this year. Reid noted that the goal of the project is to ensure that remittance transfers between Europe and Indonesia are settled within 24-hours — the time it usually takes for domestic wire transfers to be completed. Sending money across international borders could take up to five days in some cases. Reid added:“The partnership is expected to drive business within the Indonesia–Europe corridor and afford Indonesians and Europeans the opportunity to seamlessly execute exchange of value across international borders.”This is important, as Indonesia’s $11 billion global personal remittance market has more than doubled since 2005, with remittances between Indonesia and Europe representing more than $500 million. Moreover, with a population of 275 million people and a trillion-dollar economy, Indonesia arguably still lacks the digital infrastructure needed to provide value exchange between identity-verified individuals.How can blockchain solve this problem?Everest has integrated blockchain into BRI’s banking system to provide users with a digital identity, known as an “EverID.” According to Reid, the Everest Platform is built upon two private, permissioned Ethereum blockchain networks.The “identity chain” allows BRI users to share certain elements of their identity, such as their name, address and income. This information is required to ensure Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering verification. A user’s identity is then linked directly to a digital account, called an “EverWallet,” which contains Everest’s CRDT token. Reid explained:“A CRDT token is a digital voucher used to capture the sender’s selected identity elements, like KYC/AML, or 5AMLD in the case of Europeans, along with foreign exchange transactions. The tokenized voucher is stable and can be conditional, programmable ‘money’ to ensure that it can only be spent on, for example, paying bills or food.”Reid noted that once a user is on-boarded to the EverWallet in Europe, remittances can easily be sent to Indonesia. The same wallet can also be used for banking, peer-to-peer payments and cryptocurrency transactions, as everything is connected to a verified digital identity.Moreover, since transactions take place across a blockchain network, each payment is tracked with a user’s associated identity. Smart contracts are also leveraged to ensure transactions adhere to legal requirements within the participating jurisdictions.Why a digital commerce platform is important for IndonesiaBRI Remittance’s executive director, Gigieh Perkasa, told Cointelegraph the company was looking for a partner that could provide a combination of identity compliance, transaction tracking and use of tokenized stable vouchers. Perkasa noted that money transfers, especially those being made by migrant workers and SMEs, account for a large portion of the bank’s remittance business. According to Perkasa, BRI recorded $8.8 billion in remittance transactions in 2019.According to the European Commission, the European Union is Indonesia’s third-largest trading partner. However, it’s been noted that remittances sent by migrant workers in Indonesia have yet to create a lasting impact on the local economy.Silvia Mila Arini, a researcher at Singapore-based think-tank Asia Research Institute, stated in an article, “Money sent by workers is generally used to meet daily needs and to fund education and the needs of children.”Douglas Borthwick, the chief marketing officer of INX, a crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that identity management is key to all banking activities and that a digital solution could provide a number of benefits both for users and financial markets:“Legacy banking systems have trouble following basic identification information, such as the identification of final beneficiaries for securities and cap-table ownership of companies. Blockchain is the perfect technology for both private and institutional investment banking, and it has the promise of changing the identity management dogma with real-time ownership transfer settlements and other important identification management related ‘relics.’”Borthwick further noted that while INX plans to enable regulated trading of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), the exchange has been working with several major banks to provide solutions for investment banking with advanced digital identification management features. He said: “This is still in its early days, but we see this as one of the key factors to the success of the rise in digital assets in the financial markets.”Digital identity for banking is beneficialDigital identity solutions will not only disrupt the remittance market in countries like Indonesia but will also create benefits globally, especially as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Julie Esser, the senior vice president of communications of CULedger, a credit union service organization, told Cointelegraph that digital identity for the banking industry is more important than ever before. She said:“As concerns over the coronavirus pandemic began to spread, credit unions started closing their lobbies, urging members to use alternative ways to access their accounts — becoming a digital credit union overnight. The volumes in these ‘open’ channels have skyrocketed.”Related: Blockchain Digital ID — Putting People in Control of Their DataCULedger currently provides 11 United States-based credit unions with a digital identity solution called MemberPass, powered by the Sovrin Network’s blockchain platform. Borthwick also commented that the coronavirus crisis is likely to cause a global movement toward digital money and assets, adding:“Identity management will become central for authorizing transactions and keeping procedures and records in order. Nothing that swipes or is separate from a ‘collective’ hive brain will be sufficient to support the wide range of identity profiles all of us will need to live in the digital age of online commerce, banking, information gathering, personalization, communities and more.”"

Good at what you do and passionate about crypto? You know what to do.”Binance to increase its staff by at least 10%While the official announcement says that Binance is willing to employ at least 100 people, the job listing page accounts for nearly 180 open positions, including potential hires. As reported by Cointelegraph, Binance has at least 800 employees on its team to date. The company’s open job listings cover diverse areas like business development, marketing, communications, customer service, finance, analytics, and frontend.As a global crypto company, Binance is hiring talent all over the world. The listings include a wide number of locations in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance to find out more information about the announcement, but did not receive an immediate response. This story will be updated should they respond.Crypto industry is apparently surging amid global economic uncertaintyBinance’s job postings are crucial amid as unemployment numbers continue to skyrocket globally. As reported by Cointelegraph, 6.6 million people in the U.S. filed for unemployment last week; a number which is more than double official estimates.Binance is not the only company that is apparently expanding its staff during this difficult social climate. In late March, major United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, reportedly announced it was expanding its team of 800 with an additional 67 hires.The news comes amid the general uptick on crypto markets, with Bitcoin (BTC) steadily recovering over the past two weeks following a plunge below $4,000 in mid-March. On March 16, Catherine Coley, the CEO of Binance US, revealed that the coronavirus quarantine in Asia drove a significant surge in trade volume.Yesterday, Binance officially announced its historic acquisition of major crypto data website, CoinMarketCap, or CMC. While both Binance and CMC ensured that the website will continue to operate independently, CMC’s interim CEO said that the company doesn’t expect any changes to the team in the near future."

42534, 2 Reasons a Deeper Correction in Stocks May End Bitcoin’s Rally to $8K ,2020-04-03t21:41:00+01:00,9947,120,"The Bitcoin price (BTC) rallied to around $7,300 on April 3, and BTC is still holding onto the $6,700 support level, meaning the price could push the dominant cryptocurrency to the $8,000 area. But, a highly accurate hedge fund manager’s stock market warning could rattle the cryptocurrency market in the short-term.Dan Niles, the founding partner of Alpha One Capital Partners, said in a note to clients that the dire economic consequence of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a steeper correction in the U.S. stock market.With Q2 earnings set to be released in the coming weeks, jobless claims exceeding 10 million, and major European economics in free fall, the appetite for high-risk assets that include single stocks and crypto assets could fade once again.Fakeout rallies have occurred frequently in 2020As Cointelegraph previously reported, prominent trader PentarhUdi predicted the Bitcoin price to recover from $5,200 to the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) at $8,500 before it eventually grinds back down to the $3,000 region.The pattern of a strong rally leading straight to an intense selloff has already been seen multiple times in the past 12 months. This is the result of Bitcoin’s price abruptly surging in a short period of time and shaking out late shorters in the market. This gives whales time to adjust their positions, often leading to a severe correction afterward.Since late March, the Bitcoin price has broken out of its correlation with the U.S. stock market. Previously, BTC closely followed the movement in the U.S. stock market, going as far as reacting to pre-market trading of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.As such, even if the price of Bitcoin sees a large upside movement to the $7,700 to $8,500 range in the short term, the price remains vulnerable to a pullback to the $3,000 to $5,000 area.BTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin’s V-shape recovery makes it vulnerableThe March 12 drop to $3,750 could have technically caused the Bitcoin price to flash crash to zero as discussed by a few industry executives. Fortunately for investors, the price impressively rebounded from $3,600 to $6,700 with barely any pullback apart from a brief wick down to $4,400.The stock market also demonstrated a similar V-shape recovery as Bitcoin, prompting renowned strategists to predict a deeper correction in the upcoming weeks.Niles said about the stock market:“I sort of laugh when I hear people talking about a V-shaped recovery because we are going to have at least 10% unemployment, my guess is closer to 20% before all of this is said and done.”Liquidated longs remain a threatThe same argument for the lack of strength of a V-shaped recovery in the equities market can be applied with Bitcoin. Given that the cryptocurrency has not established strong support levels during its recovery to the $6,700 to $7,300 range, it faces a risk of a March 12-esque fall where a significant amount of long contracts are liquidated in a short period of time.A long accumulation phase, in contrast to a V-shape recovery, allows spot volume to grow and actual retail investors to buy into the market, rather than highly-leveraged futures orders affecting the short-term price trend of BTC."

42526, Malaysian Securities Regulator Approves Crypto Trading Platform ,2020-04-03t20:21:00+01:00,3906,139,"Following a nine-month-long probationary period, Malaysia-based cryptocurrency trading firm, Tokenize Malaysia, has received full approval from local securities watchdog.With the approval to operate a Digital Assets Exchange, the company’s cryptocurrency trading platform, Tokenize Xchange, became legally approved and regulated by the Securities Commission (SC) of Malaysia, local news outlet, SoyaCincau, reported on April 3. The exchange offers fiat-to-digital asset pairings.Malaysian laws require that local cryptocurrency exchanges register with the SC, after which they have up to nine month to achieve compliance with the SC’s regulation standards.Commenting on the development, Hong Qi Yu, CEO and CTO at Tokenize Malaysia, said:“We are now able to go ‘live’ in Malaysia and it is perfect timing –- as we have received many interested enquiries from individuals aged 24 to 50 years old who are keen to invest in digital assets.”The SC registered the firm — along with Luno Malaysia and Sinegy Technologies — last June. At the time, Luno stated that the aforementioned three exchanges were the only registered digital asset exchanges to operate in Malaysia.The SC introduced the Capital Markets and Services (Prescription of Securities) (Digital Currency and Digital Token) Order 2019 on January 15, 2019. The regulation classifies digital currencies, tokens, and crypto-assets as securities, placing them under the Securities Commission’s authority.Crypto regulations in other countriesWhile some countries undertake efforts to develop adequate cryptocurrency-related regulations, others are in no hurry to give digital assets the green light. Thus, after facing multiple delays, the adoption of Russia’s major cryptocurrency law will be postponed again, this time due to the coronavirus.A pending bill may still inhibit cryptocurrencies from flourishing in India, with India’s parliament yet to rule on the ""Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill"" from 2019.

42522, Crypto Firm’s New Prepaid Card Accepted Wherever Mastercard Is ,2020-04-03t19:32:00+01:00,2337,33,"A crypto company has launched a prepaid card that enables consumers to spend their digital assets freely.Embily can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted and boasts a daily ATM withdrawal limit of $2,500 — substantially higher than conventional bank cards.The product is available worldwide, and Embily says all funds are insured. Better still, cards are fully customizable, meaning owners get the chance to really show their personalities and make a statement.Presently, the Embily team says the card can be topped up with three types of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether and Tether. “Strong community coins” are also going to be added in the not-too-distant future.Fast transfersEmbily says its goal is to make using prepaid cards as quick and convenient as possible. Just 10 block transactions are required when an account is being topped up using ETH.Videos online have illustrated how quickly these top-ups take place, meaning users won’t have to wait long before they can hit the shops and indulge in retail therapy. The card’s balance can easily be accessed online in real time, with a comprehensive transaction history detailing how funds have been spent.Up to $13,000 can be loaded onto a card in any single transaction, and the maximum balance that a card can hold is limitless. From here, it’s easy to book hotels, hire cars, buy things online and pay for dinner just like someone would with their old-fashioned debit or credit card.More insights from Embily hereThe regular Embily card is a plastic card with contactless-payment functionality and various colors that will be available for order soon. Part of the card has been made from metal — with individual designs that help owners stand out from the crowd on nights out and at business meetings.What’s nextTwo mobile apps have been developed to accompany the Embily prepaid card, one on iOS and the other on Android. Both apps are currently in beta testing, and the company says they will be available for download on the App Store and Google Play very soon. A web version is available right now.The next step will see Embily begin to offer a crypto wallet for its customers. This will mean that they can hold and use their cryptocurrency on a single platform in a “convenient, fast and safe” way — all without having to log into multiple exchanges.Back in August, Embily’s prepaid card business was acquired by the Blockchain International Group Singapore.Since launch, the company has been focusing its efforts on the Asian market — all with a view to becoming a dominant force on the continent that would pave the way for its prepaid card to become a common sight around the world.Embily was first established in Dubai back in June 2017, and now boasts team members from a diverse range of backgrounds. Professionals who work at the company hail from around the world, specializing in everything from digital marketing to finance. Their goal is simple: “to come together and build something great.”Taking crypto mainstreamEnsuring that cryptocurrencies can be spent in traditional brick-and-mortar stores — as well as online — has been a major hurdle for the industry. Delivering an easy way to spend digital assets is a surefire way to increase levels of adoption beyond hardcore crypto enthusiasts.There are benefits for merchants, too. Having the ability to accept crypto payments, which are immediately converted into fiat at the point of purchase, allows them to broaden their appeal to a wider cross-section of customers.Embily is hoping to be at the forefront of this revolution — delivering “innovation, ease and sophistication in one neat package.”Learn more about EmbilyDisclaimer.

42526, Malaysian Securities Regulator Approves Crypto Trading Platform ,2020-04-03t20:21:00+01:00,3908,139,"Following a nine-month-long probationary period, Malaysia-based cryptocurrency trading firm, Tokenize Malaysia, has received full approval from local securities watchdog.With the approval to operate a Digital Assets Exchange, the company’s cryptocurrency trading platform, Tokenize Xchange, became legally approved and regulated by the Securities Commission (SC) of Malaysia, local news outlet, SoyaCincau, reported on April 3. The exchange offers fiat-to-digital asset pairings.Malaysian laws require that local cryptocurrency exchanges register with the SC, after which they have up to nine month to achieve compliance with the SC’s regulation standards.Commenting on the development, Hong Qi Yu, CEO and CTO at Tokenize Malaysia, said:“We are now able to go ‘live’ in Malaysia and it is perfect timing –- as we have received many interested enquiries from individuals aged 24 to 50 years old who are keen to invest in digital assets.”The SC registered the firm — along with Luno Malaysia and Sinegy Technologies — last June. At the time, Luno stated that the aforementioned three exchanges were the only registered digital asset exchanges to operate in Malaysia.The SC introduced the Capital Markets and Services (Prescription of Securities) (Digital Currency and Digital Token) Order 2019 on January 15, 2019. The regulation classifies digital currencies, tokens, and crypto-assets as securities, placing them under the Securities Commission’s authority.Crypto regulations in other countriesWhile some countries undertake efforts to develop adequate cryptocurrency-related regulations, others are in no hurry to give digital assets the green light. Thus, after facing multiple delays, the adoption of Russia’s major cryptocurrency law will be postponed again, this time due to the coronavirus.A pending bill may still inhibit cryptocurrencies from flourishing in India, with India’s parliament yet to rule on the ""Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill"" from 2019. If passed, the bill will introduce unique regulatory frameworks for virtual currencies, utility tokens, and commodity-backed tokens."
42522, Crypto Firm’s New Prepaid Card Accepted Wherever Mastercard Is ,2020-04-03t19:32:00+01:00,2339,33,"A crypto company has launched a prepaid card that enables consumers to spend their digital assets freely.Embily can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted and boasts a daily ATM withdrawal limit of $2,500 — substantially higher than conventional bank cards.The product is available worldwide, and Embily says all funds are insured. Better still, cards are fully customizable, meaning owners get the chance to really show their personalities and make a statement.Presently, the Embily team says the card can be topped up with three types of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether and Tether. “Strong community coins” are also going to be added in the not-too-distant future.Fast transfersEmbily says its goal is to make using prepaid cards as quick and convenient as possible. Just 10 block transactions are required when an account is being topped up using ETH.Videos online have illustrated how quickly these top-ups take place, meaning users won’t have to wait long before they can hit the shops and indulge in retail therapy. The card’s balance can easily be accessed online in real time, with a comprehensive transaction history detailing how funds have been spent.Up to $13,000 can be loaded onto a card in any single transaction, and the maximum balance that a card can hold is limitless. From here, it’s easy to book hotels, hire cars, buy things online and pay for dinner just like someone would with their old-fashioned debit or credit card.More insights from Embily hereThe regular Embily card is a plastic card with contactless-payment functionality and various colors that will be available for order soon. Part of the card has been made from metal — with individual designs that help owners stand out from the crowd on nights out and at business meetings.What’s nextTwo mobile apps have been developed to accompany the Embily prepaid card, one on iOS and the other on Android. Both apps are currently in beta testing, and the company says they will be available for download on the App Store and Google Play very soon. A web version is available right now.The next step will see Embily begin to offer a crypto wallet for its customers. This will mean that they can hold and use their cryptocurrency on a single platform in a “convenient, fast and safe” way — all without having to log into multiple exchanges.Back in August, Embily’s prepaid card business was acquired by the Blockchain International Group Singapore.Since launch, the company has been focusing its efforts on the Asian market — all with a view to becoming a dominant force on the continent that would pave the way for its prepaid card to become a common sight around the world.Embily was first established in Dubai back in June 2017, and now boasts team members from a diverse range of backgrounds. Professionals who work at the company hail from around the world, specializing in everything from digital marketing to finance. Their goal is simple: “to come together and build something great.”Taking crypto mainstreamEnsuring that cryptocurrencies can be spent in traditional brick-and-mortar stores — as well as online — has been a major hurdle for the industry. Delivering an easy way to spend digital assets is a surefire way to increase levels of adoption beyond hardcore crypto enthusiasts.There are benefits for merchants, too. Having the ability to accept crypto payments, which are immediately converted into fiat at the point of purchase, allows them to broaden their appeal to a wider cross-section of customers.Embily is hoping to be at the forefront of this revolution — delivering “innovation, ease and sophistication in one neat package.”Learn more about EmbilyDisclaimer.

McAfee tweeted:“Those able to leave your homes during quarantine ... (to buy food or get medical care, etc.) ... Take photos of interesting aspects of your vacant cities, highways, etc. $500 in DAI crypto paid for the best photo (Chosen by @theemrsmcafee next week) Just drop photos here:)”Submissions began to flood McAfee’s feed within minutes of the tweet. One Twitter user posted this pic of a herd of goats prowling around a quiet neighborhood:(Source: Twitter, @freethemkitties)Another user exemplified the extent of the coronavirus lockdown with this picture of a vacant Grand Central Station in New York during rush hour.(Source: Twitter, @m3digital)The latest figures show 92,743 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New York alone. The East Coast of the United States appears to have been hit hardest by the spread of the virus. This photograph of the Las Vegas Strip shows that the reaction to the lockdown has been similar across the country, however. Nevada has 1,484 confirmed cases thus far.(Source: Twitter, @larry_buckeye)The winning photograph will be selected next week by John McAfee’s wife, Janice McAfee — aka @themrsmcafee.Stability, DAI and dangerous tweetsWhen asked by Cointelegraph why he had selected the dollar-pegged DAI, McAfee’s answer was brief. He replied:“Stable coin.”DAI is the stablecoin that underpins the decentralized finance applicationMakerDAO. The stability of DAI was brought into question in early March, when the crypto market suffered one of its worst crashes in recent memory.The sudden drop wreaked havoc with MakerDAO’s Ethereum-backed loans, when the price of ETH dropped 54% in just nine days. Between January and March of 2019, the price of DAI fluctuated between $0.96 and $1.08, in line with fluctuations in the wider market.Regardless of the payment method, McAfee appears to be testing the venom of Twitter’s censors, who have already been proactive in silencing what they deem to be dangerous or misleading posts.In March, McAfee had a tweet of his removed, which stated: “Coronavirus cannot attack black people because it is a Chinese virus.”How will Twitter’s censors react to McAfee monetarily incentivizing photography trips during the coronavirus lockdown?"
42518, Past Halvings in Review: Case for an Immediate Bitcoin Upsurge Is Flawed ,2020-04-03t19:10:00+01:00,7561,137,"The block reward halving of Bitcoin (BTC) has long been touted as an optimistic factor to drive the short-term price trend of BTC in the first half of 2020. Historical data, however, shows that the halving does not necessarily coincide with an immediate upsurge in the price of Bitcoin.On the Bitcoin network, miners create blocks that record Bitcoin transactions to essentially verify and confirm payment data using computing power. Through large-scale mining centers filled with ASIC mining chips and sophisticated equipment, miners use a large amount of electricity and have high maintenance costs in order to mine BTC. Individual or small producers can mine BTC through pools — i.e., a group of miners that work together by contributing their computing power to mine Bitcoin blocks.Every four years, the reward of mining Bitcoin halves, dropping the revenues of miners by 50%. Often, miners prepare for halvings by saving six to 12 months of cash as a buffer to ensure that even if Bitcoin’s price drops after the halving, their businesses can be sustained.What does the historical data say?The first halving of the Bitcoin network occurred on Nov. 28, 2012. At the time, there were only a handful of major cryptocurrency exchanges that facilitated Bitcoin trading, and it was still relatively difficult to purchase Bitcoin. For that reason, many analysts made the argument that market data prior to 2016 — when there were a limited number of exchanges — may not be reliable.BTC USDT 1-month chart. Source: TradingViewAfter the first halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin took about 11 months to enter a parabolic rally, securing extended upward momentum. In November 2012, the price was hovering at around $12 on Bitstamp. In November 2013, Bitcoin had climbed to as high as $1,100, recording a 7,562% increase in price.The second halving of the Bitcoin network occurred in July 2016. Coming off of a sharp price decline from $1,100, the price of BTC stabilized at around $600. The price then started to see a strong rally in May 2017, exactly 11 months after the halving occurred — just like in 2012. So, the past two halvings show that Bitcoin’s price tends to see a vertical rally 10 to 11 months after the halvings took place, but not immediately after.Why does the Bitcoin price rally many months after halvings?Large miners tend to save a cash-buffer for up to 12 months prior to a block reward halving, as the risk of the BTC price going down subsequent to a mining revenue cut is always present. But, small miners do not have the financial means or resources to prepare for the halving in advance.Various data points, including Digital Assets Data’s 21-Day Miner's Rolling Inventory, show that miners have been selling more BTC than they mine in recent weeks. As hinted by major investors such as Joe007, arguably the biggest whale on Bitfinex, the potential sell-off of BTC by miners has not been priced into the market.When small miners continue to sell their Bitcoin, it applies increasing selling pressure on the cryptocurrency exchange market. Some miners tend to sell crypto assets through the over-the-counter market; over time, however, OTC data also gets reflected by the cryptocurrency exchange market.In mid-March, Joe007 warned that “overleveraged miners” will be unbelievably hurt by the time the halving comes, which could translate to the capitulation of some miners and, ultimately, the sell-off of Bitcoin through both exchanges and OTC platforms.Why do investors expect the Bitcoin price to increase after the halving?The main reason behind the widespread expectation of a short-term increase in the price of Bitcoin following the block reward halving in May is that the breakeven price of Bitcoin mining increases to anywhere between $12,000 to $15,000, as TradeBlock’s head of research, John Todaro, stated earlier in 2020. Many investors theorized that since it costs $12,000 to mine Bitcoin, it would be logical to have the BTC price above $12,000 after the halving.While BTC could eventually enter the $12,000 to $15,000 range in the future, major miners prepare large cash-buffers precisely as a countermeasure against a possible dip in the price of Bitcoin subsequent to the halving.Todaro’s research also found that newer mining equipment is consistently being developed by major companies like Bitmain and Canaan, which also makes it a variable in calculating the breakeven price of mining. Efficient mining equipment, together with cheaper electricity and resources, can substantially decrease the breakeven price of mining, even after a halving occurs, according to research by TradeBlock.For large miners that have the cash-buffer and resources to speedily obtain new mining equipment, the eventual drop in mining difficulty through automatic adjustments make it possible to sustain their businesses through the early months following a halving.What’s next for BTC?If the Bitcoin price trend follows historical performance, as seen in 2012 and 2016, then Bitcoin should increase significantly in mid-2021, 10 to 11 months out from the halving scheduled to be activated in May. As such, there is a strong possibility that price will remain well below the breakeven price of mining over the next few months.However, the popular theory that the hash rate of the Bitcoin network could reflect the decline in mining revenues — and thus lead to a “death spiral” to severely downgrade the Bitcoin network security — has not been proven to be accurate, based on historical data and on-chain research.Despite the halving being one month out, the hash rate of the Bitcoin network has dropped only to December 2019 levels. Because the network’s hash rate has consistently achieved new record highs throughout the past two years, there is a low probability that the halving would have a noticeably large negative impact on the hash rate.Source: Blockchain.comA study by BitMEX found a variety of scenarios that could play out, such as: “The halvening has a much larger impact on the network hashrate, causing a 47% decline” or one in which “the halvening only caused a 12% drop in the network hashrate.”That means that even if Bitcoin’s price remains below the cost to mine BTC and stays that way for the next three to four months, and given that large miners tend to prepare in advance and that hash rate rarely drops by a large margin, the hash rate of the Bitcoin network is likely to remain stable until the BTC price begins to reflect the cost of mining.The halving may shake out overleveraged and small miners in the near-term, the same way a drop in the price of Bitcoin can shake out overleveraged traders, as it is not likely to trigger an immediate price spike of BTC. But over the medium to long term, the fundamentals of the Bitcoin network and mining ecosystem are expected to remain strong.Both minor and major acquisitions in the mining sector are ongoing despite the market dip and the stagnation in the cryptocurrency market, as seen in a $2.8 million acquisition of a Bitcoin mining center in Quebec, Canada on March 30, 2020. This suggests that miners expect a short-term drop-off in the global cryptocurrency mining sector, but a recovery over the long run."
42517, South African National Blockchain Alliance Holds Online Launch ,2020-04-03t18:50:00+01:00,1352,117,"The South African National Blockchain Alliance carried out an online livestream launch while the country is in the midst of a 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The organization was due to be launched at the beginning of April in Johannesburg but had to be taken online as South Africa and the world tackles a global health crisis.The launch happened during a livestream on YouTube on April 3, which included a panel of speakers elaborating on how SANBA will help nurture blockchain-focused startups and companies that are developing capabilities using the technology.Bringing parties togetherSANBA has been set up by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and its subsidiary, the Office for Digital Advantage. These bodies fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Science and Innovation.Akhona Damane heads up the project and said that SANBA intends to be the central cog in a network of partnerships between South Africa’s government, industry-leading companies, startups and civil society. An important consideration for SANBA is the development of blockchain-based systems and solutions coming from inside South Africa, as Damane told Cointelegraph:“There is a lot of venture capital out there, we need to provide support to startups in the country. There are new job opportunities and a chance for new economic participation. Satoshi’s paper was looking at democratizing economies. In South Africa, that has worked, there are even people in deep rural areas that buy and trade cryptocurrency using smartphones.”Another major focus will be driving the development of skills needed to explore and create blockchain solutions. An integral part of this will be educating civil society on the various use cases and further potential of the technology to improve a wide variety of industries.The importance of supporting academiaEducation and developing skills will form a major part of SANBA’s focus over the next few years. The launch event highlighted the work being done by the University of Cape Town to help incubate talent in the space. Co-Pierre Georg, an associate professor at UCT’s School of Economics, said that the university is the first in Africa to offer a master’s degree program in fintech, which has been modeled on the programs of universities in the United States, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California, Berkley.Georg said that a major hurdle in South Africa is having the capacity to develop talent in the space. The professor also said there had been 400 applicants for the 15 spots available for the program:“We need to create people who can code. Quite simply, they need to know some finance and organizational skills, but the core skill lacking is coding ability. There is not a deep enough skill set in the country.”Another problem is the allure of opportunities offshore, as Georg noted that as soon as the program educates students with those highly sought-after skill sets, they begin to receive offers from companies, and the university cannot entice them to stay for a Ph.D.:“The second step is creating a pipeline that develops skills, which in turn leads to those people creating companies. We need to build companies that can scale globally but are based in South Africa.”Tertiary education institutions will also be receiving support from SANBA. Damane told Cointelegraph that the Department of Science and Innovation is exploring an exchange program for students taking blockchain-focused courses:“At the academic front, SANBA is committed to developing a blockchain curriculum which encourages the uptake of courses at undergraduate level. We also envision the facilitation of funding of a few postgraduate research students in collaboration with partners. This will be linked to the commitment with the DSI country-partners such as Swiss Embassy in Pretoria, which has activated the Switzerland based institutions such as the University of Basel to participate in the joint international students' exchange program later in 2020.”South Africa is catching upSANBA has made it clear that it wants to be the middleman that connects the various industry players that will drive blockchain development and use in the country. At the same time, it also defines its role as creating a “pre-competitive space” for research and development. Monica Singer, ConsenSys’s lead for South Africa, spoke to Cointelegraph following the online launch.Having joined ConsenSys in 2017, Singer says she has faced an uphill battle trying to get industry players to warm up to blockchain technology. She said that she had been advocating the use of blockchain systems to heads of various enterprises over the past three years, but was met with disdain in various instances when she used the example of Bitcoin as a starting point to explain the tenets of blockchain technology.Moving away from any mention of cryptocurrencies, Singer still struggled to get big businesses to open up to the potential benefits of decentralized systems or smart contracts, saying it was too much for people to embrace. Now that a government-backed entity is finally spearheading a collaborative organization that will drive the development of the space, Singer is far more optimistic about the road ahead, telling Cointelegraph:“I have been so worried that South Africa is falling behind in innovation and not embracing this technology, which has so much potential to eliminate corruption and fraud that has plagued our government in the last 10 years. To witness the birth of a national initiative at the government level from the Department of Science and Technology is a historically much-needed move to ensure that we raise the level of awareness among all our people.”Singer is positive that South African enterprises, educational institutions and startups will get the necessary support to use blockchain-based solutions in order to drive the country forward:“The narrative can now be changed to explore the potential that this technology has to improve the lives of the citizens in a country and to bring trust and accountability to the recording of transactions of value using the internet of value we are building in Ethereum and other platforms.”Impact across industriesAs a collaborative initiative, SANBA is made up of a broad range of businesses, startups and institutions. Daniel Visser, a research and development strategy manager for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, also weighed in during the online launch on the potential effects that SANBA could have in the country.Visser explained that the CSIR is an affiliate of the World Economic Forum’s network for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As a result, the CSIR is constantly looking at issues with policies around emerging technology and how those can be improved to drive adoption. Visser added:“From a blockchain perspective, there are so many areas to consider. We went through a number of different areas that could benefit. Supply chain is a big factor, green chain, cold chain and the likes. What are the things that need to be in place to adopt the tech?”Visser also highlighted the fact that South Africa has large areas that don’t have access to traditional financial means, which opens the door for micro-trading and transactional applications. Other major considerations are decentralized-identity solutions, educational certifications and governmental transparency. Visser believes all of these could be greatly improved by blockchain technology.Meanwhile, Damane opined that SANBA will have the biggest impact in the entrepreneurial space in South Africa. He identifies small enterprises like startups as crucial participants within the blockchain development ecosystem:“SANBA will become the catalyst — linking startup solutions to government and industry needs, entrepreneurs to VC funding, and so forth. These enterprises have the potential to contribute to economic growth and job creation, which is a major challenge especially among the youth.”Damane added that SANBA has begun identifying sectors for proofs of concept and use cases that include digital identity solutions, micro-credentials and health care. A wide variety of cross-industry participation should lead to investment:“This will force the entire ecosystem to leverage the efforts of existing players rather than reinventing the wheel. Hence, we envision public-private partnerships to emerge, with a significant co-investment being made, which will ultimately benefit the startup community.”A chance to overhaul government systemsWhile the launch of SANBA signals the beginning of a collaborative effort across industries, the South African government could be a prime candidate for a blockchain-driven overhaul. That is the opinion of Singer, who sees the potential of the technology to improve a number of governmental departments in South Africa.Singer believes this could be a catalyst in creating more efficient, transparent government departments and addressing wasteful expenditure, which has been a concern in South Africa for many years: “SANBA can take the leadership in guiding the various projects where they are needed the most and to coordinate at a government overall level.” Self-sovereign identity solutions could also help improve the lives of individuals and help the government streamline a variety of essential services for its citizens, according to Singer, who added:“Once we implement a self-sovereign identity decentralized database of personal records for each citizen, this can be used by various government departments so the passport, the ID, the record of your degrees, your medical information, your title deeds of your property, your driver’s license, your license of your ownership of your vehicle, etc. is all in the data under the control of the citizen.”Celebrating collaborationThe online launch of SANBA was preceded by a personal message from Cardano founder and CEO Charles Hoskinson. The tech entrepreneur was supposed to headline the Blockchain Africa conference last month but was forced to pull out due to travel restrictions due to the coronavirus. Hoskinson applauded the South African government for doing its part to drive the development of new technology in the country and continent, saying:“It is so important that people focus on foundational research and development, as well as time, effort and money to really chase the future. I’m glad to see that the appetite and ambition for innovation and building public-private partnerships with entrepreneurs and people in emerging industries has not been lost in these sad times.”Singer echoed those sentiments, telling Cointelegraph that the foundation of SANBA could have lasting effects in driving the development of technological solutions in South Africa:“SANBA will make a massive difference as we have not made much progress to date, as a country in studying this technology and exploring its opportunities and determining the art of what is possible. Just by creating a forum where parties can share information and encourage students to learn how to code it will have a huge impact. I also hope that SANBA will guide the various government departments as to what are their key pain points that can be resolved with this technology.”"

The firm has an annual supply of over 8 billion cubic meters.Shanghai Gas expands blockchain adoptionShanghai Gas’ trial used distributed ledger technology, or DLT, provided by VeChain to comprehensively monitor its supply chain and identify opportunities for efficiency savings and reduced operational costs.The expanded partnership will see Shanghai Gas build “a trust-free ‘Energy-as-a-Service’ ecosystem” in partnership with VeChain and electricity provider ENN Energy Holdings.ENN generates electricity for 17 provinces, more than 16 million residential dwellings, and nearly 100,000 industrial customers. The firm has a market cap of $85 billion.Pilot concludes after 16 monthsThe three companies have participated in the Blockchain-Enabled LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) Solution pilot together since November 2018.The pilot was found to have “significantly eliminate[d] information barriers in the supply chain, contribute[d] to a transparent product process, and provide[d] a reliable database for LNG risk management.”Blockchain in energy to see $35B in investment by 2025DLT is increasingly seeing adoption from the energy industry, with a recent report estimating that applications for blockchain technology within the energy sector will drive year-over-year investment growth at a rate of 82%.If the forecast is accurate, blockchain would represent nearly 2% of the entire $1.85 trillion industry by 2025."
42513, UnionBank Head Foresees the End of Physical Cash ,2020-04-03t18:30:00+01:00,3410,243,"Edwin Bautista, president and chief executive of UnionBank of the Philippines, has forecast that the coronavirus outbreak will drive banks to shift towards digital currencies, leaving physical cash behind.As Euromoney reported on April 3, Bautista noted that the pandemic provoked a heightened demand in online banking services, pushing banks to revise their digitization strategy. “Certainly, this pandemic amplifies the need for all banks to go digital now,” Bautista said.Going further, the exec projected the beginning of the end of hard cash, especially if central banks fail to deliver notes and coins to banks and automated teller machines. Bautista stated:“One key realization here is that the longer the disruption, the more tenuous the traditional cash supply chain becomes. Thus I expect that banks will be more open to testing, developing and deploying digital cash and currencies, QR codes and maybe even cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.”“The crisis will fast track the shift towards digital,” which “represents a tremendous new opportunity for banking,” according to Bautista.UnionBank’s experiments with blockchainUnionBank has indeed demonstrated a proactive approach to blockchain-related developments. Last July, the bank launched a payments-focused stablecoin pegged to the Philippine peso. The coin, dubbed PHX, is designed to function as “a stable store of value, medium of exchange and is a programmable token with self-executing logic.”That same month, UnionBank successfully piloted a blockchain-based cross-border remittance from the Philippines to Singapore. The project eventually aims to provide millions of unbanked Filipinos with the ability to use financial services by connecting rural banks to the country's main financial network.Meanwhile, other world banks continue to advance the development of their own digital currencies. The Bank of France officially launched an experimental program to test the integration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for interbank settlements, while the Bahamas announced plans to adopt a CBDC no later than 2020."

They include James Seijas, who worked as a financial advisor for Wells Fargo until March 2019, Quan Tran, a surgeon, and Michael Ackerman, who was a New York Stock Exchange institutional broker. These three are thought to have appropriated money from at least 20 victims who relayed their complaints in the court.The Q3 Recovery Vehicle stated the following:“The founders claimed, fraudulently, that the investments would be used to trade cryptocurrency using a proprietary and wildly successful algorithm developed by Ackerman.”Less than $10 million was used for crypto tradingAccording to the complaint, less than $10 million “and possibly less than $5 million” of the collected investments were used for virtual currency trading. Meanwhile, the defendants allegedly misappropriated at least $20 million for their personal use.The recovery vehicle claimed that between August 2017 and December 2019, all funds were collected to finance the Ponzi scheme, including posts on a doctor-centric Facebook group.Donna Seijas (wife of James Seijas) and Steve Saunders, who was the vice presidents of operations for Skyway Capital Markets LLC, are also mentioned in the complaint."
42508, ShapeShift Enables US-Based Customers to Buy Crypto With Debit Card ,2020-04-03t17:30:00+01:00,3237,129,"Switzerland-based crypto exchange, ShapeShift, has enabled its United States-based customers to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with a debit card in the new exchange’s platform.ShapeShift’s founder, Eric Voorhees, announced the development in a tweet on April 3, saying:“If you're in the US, you can buy Bitcoin instantly in the new ShapeShift.com platform with your debit card. You can literally have the Bitcoin, in your possession, five minutes from now.”KYC processes complianceShapeShift’s new platform doesn’t require account verification to purchase cryptocurrencies, which has led to questions from the tweet’s commentators.When asked about the project’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policy, Voorhees confirmed that KYC is not required. This is due to the fact that, as is the case with Shapeshift, the platform does not actually hold custody of customer funds. Since transfers occur P2P between wallets owned and controlled by individual users, KYC measures are not strictly necessary.ShapeShift has not yet released a mobile app, and only allows customers to purchase crypto via debit card through its web platform.Crypto industry actively adopts debit and credit cardsCrypto exchanges have been actively adding support for debit cards, with some of them even issuing their own. Most recently, major crypto exchange, Binance, entered the crypto debit card sector with news of an official Binance Card. Issued by Visa, the card is initially only available in South East Asia, though the company states that other regions will be unlocked soon.Earlier this year, Coinbase became a principal member of Visa, which allows it to issue debit cards without relying on third parties. The company’s Coinbase Card connects to each user’s Coinbase account, allowing individuals to spend their crypto balance via an instant conversion to fiat."
42505," Amid Widespread Privacy Coin Delistings, Bitstamp Considers Zcash Support ",2020-04-03t17:00:00+01:00,2138,59,"Bitstamp, one of the longest-running active cryptocurrency exchanges, is considering launching a batch of new crypto asset listings.Curiously, Bitstamp is contemplating support for Zcash (ZEC), despite an increasing number of exchanges seeking to distance themselves from privacy coins due to associated regulatory risks.Bitfinex considers first new listings in 3 yearsOn March 31, Bitstamp announced it is “actively exploring” support for seven crypto assets, including two stablecoins and one privacy coin.The prospective listings comprise Basic Attention Token (BAT), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Paxos Standard (PAX), 0x (ZRX), USD Coin (USDC), and Zcash.Exchanges abandon privacy coinsIn 2019, updated money laundering guidelines from the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, comprised the catalyst for a spate of privacy coin delistings.During August 2019, leading U.S.-based exchange Coinbase announced that it would no longer offer support for Zcash custody and pairing for customers based in the U.K.In September, South Korean exchanges, OKEx and Upbit, announced they would cease support for several privacy coins including ZEC, Monero (XMR), and Dash (DASH); crypto assets described as “the three anonymous siblings” by Japanese regulators.BitBay also dropped XMR in November 2019.Users may see signs of prospective listings on BitstampThe exchange notes that consideration of the prospective listings will involve “strict technical, safety and compliance reviews, as well as regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions.”Bitstamp adds that users may notice “signs of engineering work” related to the crypto assets under consideration, adding: “We cannot guarantee that this will result in any new listings and it does not disqualify any other assets from being monitored for possible support at Bitstamp.”Should Bitstamp support a new crypto asset, it will be the exchange’s first new listing since Bitcoin Cash in 2017, and the first listing introduced by NXMH — the Belgium-based investment company who acquired Bitstamp in October 2018."
42504," As Malta Delays Regulatory Clarity, Fewer Firms Remain on ‘Blockchain Island’ ",2020-04-03t16:25:00+01:00,5540,73,"It seems that Malta is becoming both less popular among and less populated with crypto firms. The European Union country attracted dozens of industry players in 2018 on the back of the “blockchain island” agenda championed by the local government, but the relevant framework has not yet proven to be effective. Meanwhile, the official rhetoric apparently started to shift away from the blockchain sector, as the government now aims to consolidate it with “other niche sectors.”Meanwhile, the Malta Financial Services Authority, continues to pluck out non-registered crypto agents — be it the world’s top crypto exchange or smaller startups. But in reality, no businesses have been licensed under the blockchain framework yet, despite it being released in the summer of 2018. As a result, a number of companies have decided to leave the island over the past months. So, who is currently based in Malta, and why?Crypto regulation was off to a fast startIn July 2018, the Maltese government approved the Digital Innovation Framework, aiming to establish a strong regulatory climate for blockchain innovation and digital assets. The framework comprises three acts: the Digital Innovation Authority Act, the Innovative Technological Arrangement and Services Act, and the Virtual Financial Asset Act.The latter, which is the most essential act out of three, required businesses to be licensed by the MFSA if they launch initial coin offerings, trade digital assets, or provide electronic wallets and brokerage activities. The act also introduces VFA Agents — the so-called “gatekeepers,” or entities that advise and support crypto firms.The agency approved the first VFA Agents in May 2019. Currently, there are 21 authorized VFA Agents, according to the MFSA’s financial register. However, no VFA licenses have been issued under the framework yet, meaning that VFA Agents have few potential clients that are willing to apply for it.Local politicians actively addressed the crypto bills when they were passed, arguing that the island nation had become a pioneer in the area. For instance, Silvio Schembri, who acted as a junior minister for financial services, digital economy and innovation, said that Malta was “the first world jurisdiction to provide legal certainty to this space,” even though nations like Canada, Japan and Belarus had already enacted cryptocurrency-specific laws.Then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was also among the crypto-friendly officeholders. In September 2018, he went as far as to present his country as a “blockchain island” at the United Nations General Assembly.Consequently, the Maltese government was especially close with crypto actors throughout 2018. In March, Muscat publically welcomed Binance to the island on his Twitter. The crypto exchange decided to move to Malta after facing regulatory difficulties in Japan, where it was previously headquartered.A few months later, Binance held a private event at the official residence of the President of Malta. “How many of you have attended a blockchain even at the presidential palace?” CEO Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, asked while giving a speech there, saying, “Malta came at a time when regulatory clarity was very much needed.”It wasn’t just Binance that was looking for a friendlier jurisdiction and low corporate tax rates — which is set at 5%, the lowest in the EU. More crypto companies soon began relocating to the island, including fellow exchanges OKEx and BitBay. On Nov. 1, 2018, the cryptocurrency framework finally came into effect — but instead of getting the long-awaited clarity, local players were left dealing with more legal ambiguity and sluggishness.Local players getting anxiousMost regulatory problems for crypto firms in Malta stem from the fact that no businesses have been licensed under the VFA framework yet, despite the fact that it’s been more than a year since it was enacted.For instance, reports suggested that local banks were declining crypto and blockchain firms’ applications to open bank accounts, saying that it was beyond their “risk appetite.” As Schembri explained to the Times of Malta at the time, banks were reluctant to engage with crypto and blockchain firms because they were waiting for them to obtain MFSA licenses first, which he said was understandable.In 2018, major crypto exchange OKEx successfully migrated to Malta from Japan after facing warnings from the local regulator. “Malta is getting crowded,” community commentators noticed at the time, when Binance was in the process of its relocation. Soon, OKEx received permission to operate and provide its services from Malta under the transitory provision granted by MFSA for a period of one year until the license is obtained, but the exchange is still waiting for a VFA license after almost two years.As the time goes by, fewer firms remain hopeful. Leon Siegmund, a board member of Malta’s Blockchain Association and founder of Bitcoin Club Malta, criticized the VFA license in a comment to crypto publication Decrypt, saying, “It’s too expensive; it doesn’t provide any value.” The MFSA reportedly requires a fee of 10,000 euros to process a pre-application for the VFA license.Additionally, Malta’s regulatory approach toward crypto businesses seems to be as stringent as that of other EU countries, given that the AMLD5 directive also applies. As Wayne Pisani, a partner at registered VFA Agent Grant Thornton, previously told Cointelegraph, “It was never the intention to create a soft touch regulatory framework.”Therefore, some actors, such as derivatives exchange Deribit and a noncustodial exchange KyberSwap, have chosen to leave the island. In January 2020, KyberSwap announced it was moving out of Malta to the British Virgin Islands. The decision to relocate was driven by practical considerations, Sunny Jain, the company’s head of product, told Cointelegraph:“KyberSwap anticipated that Malta will adopt a very strict implementation of new EU regulations for crypto companies. Under these new regulations, KyberSwap would require an extensive amount of information from our current and future customers, and overall costs might increase.”Other companies that have cut ties with Maltese regulators include Bittrex and even the once-darling Binance. Bittrex announced it was relocating its headquarters to Liechtenstein in October 2019, just one month after the MFSA declared that it would “actively monitor” licensed crypto firms in the country (Bittrex declined to comment on this story nor to clarify the specific reasons for leaving Malta), while Binance was unexpectedly called out by the regulator, which issued a statement saying that the exchange “is not authorized by the MFSA to operate in the crypto currency sphere,” to which CZ said that Binance “is not headquartered or operated in Malta.”The MFSA has now clarified to Cointelegraph that it issued the press statement to correct an article published by the Times of Malta, “which gave the impression that Binance was licensed to operate as a crypto exchange in and from Malta.” The spokesperson for the MFSA added that the agency is currently processing a number of applications, most of which are for crypto exchanges, adding that the aim is to establish the “highest standards of compliance and governance” for local businesses:“The MFSA's stance has always been the same and remains unchanged: to operate in the virtual financial assets sphere in Malta, the highest standards of compliance and governance in the conduct of business, including AML/CFT standards, have to be adhered to, both at on-boarding stage and throughout the lifecycle of the licensed activity.”Either way, it seems that Binance’s relationship with local authorities has apparently worsened, especially since Muscat stepped down due to a political crisis in the country at the end of 2019, which was followed by a cabinet reshuffle. The exchange has yet to respond to a request for comment.Other companies that have seemingly left Malta include an Indian exchange Zebpay. The company moved to the island in October 2018 after the Reserve Bank of India banned crypto-related transactions in the country. Although things seemed good at the start — with CEO Ajeet Khurana saying in March 2019 that he was pleasantly surprised at how open-minded the Maltese government was — the company ultimately closed down its Maltese subsidiary.In August 2019, less than a year after it moved to the EU country, the exchange informed its users that Zebpay Malta was shutting down. When asked to comment, however, a representative for the company said it is not “relevant” to this article because “ZebPay still has our Malta entity.” The spokesperson added, “We have just put EU operations on the backburner while we review our overall operations and refocus on core competencies.”Further, investment trading market Coinvest, which once announced it was joining leading blockchain companies in moving to Malta, has since decided not to move forward with its registration in Malta citing a lack of progress, as confirmed to Cointelegraph by the firm’s representative.Not everyone has leftThe political crisis, which was largely fuelled by allegations of corruption and lead to Muscat’s resignation, might be a crucial factor for the current regulatory stagnation, according to Sidharth Sogani, CEO at crypto-focused research and intelligence firm Crebaco, who told Cointelegraph:“At this point, Malta doesn't seem to have a proper loophole-free regulatory framework that takes care of illicit activities arising out of the Crypto industry and maybe that is the reason why the new licenses are delayed and the existing businesses are facing regulatory and compliance hurdles.”“Over the last few months, we have seen an exodus of companies leaving Malta,” Cal Evans, the founder of compliance and strategy firm Gresham International, summarized in a comment for Cointelegraph, elaborating that the local regulation seems to be the main reason:“The island made great steps toward creating crypto-friendly laws, but made little to no steps in implementing them. To date, it is rumored that only two licenses have been issued. The Maltese authorities seemingly unwilling, or unable, to issue the licenses companies so desperately wanted to prove legitimacy.”However, some Malta-based actors remain optimistic. Jan Sammut, the founder of ICO Launch Malta, told Cointelegraph:“Whilst the consensus is that the VFA act is overly onerous and that its implementation leaves much to be desired, the Maltese jurisdiction as a whole remains a very attractive prospect for blockchain companies. Therefore, apart from the few who made the decision to relocate to other jurisdictions very early on, most remain based here operating under their transitional period provisions.”Similarly, a representative for OKEx reiterated the exchange’s commitment to stay in Malta in a comment to Cointelegraph, saying that there is still room for the crypto sector to grow on the island:“We believe the Maltese government is very committed to crypto and they do have one of the most comprehensive crypto regulatory frameworks in the EU. Yet, OKEx will always be here to keep our commitment in joining hands with the Maltese government to build the ecosystem.”Experts warn that further short-term developments are unlikelyAs for now, the future of the crypto industry in Malta seems uncertain — the VFA act has yet to be implemented in full after almost two years. As Sogani suggested, this process might take even more time due to the pandemic: “I believe we won’t see any concrete revised regulation coming in the next six months, as a lot of things have been delayed due to the coronavirus lockdown.” The MFSA did not reply to Cointelegraph's request for comment by press time.A MFSA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that it has received a total of 22 applications from prospective VFA Service Providers, where 14 are for VFA exchanges, stressing that it had started the reviewing process in December last year:“Following the transitory period, which ended last October, the first application packs started to be submitted toward the end of December 2019, after which the MFSA initiated the applications reviewing process.”The agency also added that “the MFSA’s fintech strategy remains that of contributing toward the establishment of a sector made up of serious operators who are properly regulated and supervised at the highest level.”Related: New Malta Government Says It Still Wants to Run a ‘Blockchain Island’When asked for a statement, Malta’s junior minister for financial services and digital economy, Bartolo Clayton, repeated his previous comment given to Cointelegraph, stating that “the Government of Malta is committed to consolidate blockchain together with other niche sectors,” adding that, “the Government of Malta is opting for an overarching and holistic strategy for the Digital, Financial and Innovative services in Malta.”Additionally, Clayton’s press office mentioned that “the Junior Minister further extends his commitment to attract more investment in these emerging sectors.”"
42500, Bail Bloc Founder Says How Monero Mining Can Help ICE Detainees ,2020-04-03t15:57:00+01:00,2236,63,"One cryptocurrency project is using Monero (XMR) to give undocumented immigrants a better shot at a fair treatment in the United States judicial system.The Bail Bloc project collects cryptocurrency to help people get out of pretrial incarceration for cases with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Unlike conventional charities, Bail Bloc doesn’t want your money — it wants your computer processing power.Cointelegraph reached out to Bail Bloc co-creator Grayson Earle for deeper insight into the initiative.Detainees make bail with MoneroUsers download a special app that uses between 10% and 50% of their overall processor capacity— the user can set the rate — to mine the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero.Bail Bloc trades its XMR for U.S. dollars every month and then donates the sum on a rotating basis to the bail funds in the National Bail Fund Network.“The idea is to get people to volunteer their spare computing power to mine, so it doesn't require them to make any cash donations. It's like creating an ad hoc supercomputer with the purpose of mining cryptocurrency,” said Earle.ICE detention and who ends up thereICE’s operations target individuals “who present a danger to national security” and “undermine the integrity of the immigration system”. However, most detainees are undocumented immigrants who otherwise have no criminal records and are detained simply for unlawful entry to the U.S.In ICE detention, people can pay an immigration bond in exchange for their immediate release, but less than half of those in detention are given a bond hearing. Those who cannot afford to pay the bond, or who are not granted a bond at all, must wait for their court hearing while detained, which could last from months to years.Additionally, ICE’s treatment of detainees has repeatedly raised concerns of violence, inappropriate segregation practices, foodservice issues, lack of recreation, and even violations of medical ethics.While Bail Bloc was initially created for individuals in the American prison system, Earle said, ""We've since re-oriented the project to pay immigration bonds for people affected by Trump's policies. This includes people who are not citizens of the U.S. who might be living here.""Bail Bloc steps inBail Bloc has mined cryptocurrency for the Immigrant Bail Fund since November 2018. The fund pays bonds for people in ICE detention across Connecticut, where the $15,000 immigration bond is nearly double the national average.There are currently some 300 users running Bail Bloc on their computers, but the number is subject to fluctuation. “At its height, we had 2,500 users at peak hours, including Grimes as she actively used it while recording her new album,” Earle revealed.It’s true — popular musician Grimes, (who was romantically linked to tech billionaire Elon Musk) tweeted about the project back in 2017, encouraging her fans to get involved:“Downloaded bail bloc onto my comp. mines crypto currency 2 pay ppls bail; SO cool! & so easy...""Why Monero?It's not surprising that Bail Bloc chose Monero as its digital currency of choice. “The anonymity of everyone we have helped to release from pre-trial detention is paramount,” Earle said, adding:“I chose Monero because it was a fairly stable coin and is ASIC-resistant. I knew that our target participant had a laptop so we needed CPU mining to be viable. More recently, Monero has made GPU mining less viable which also improves the viability of our project.”"

42495, Coronavirus Pandemic Reminds Us That Security Is Important During the Zoom Boom ,2020-04-03t15:11:00+01:00,1431,80,"Even with all the looming uncertainty surrounding the global COVID-19 pandemic, system security needs to remain at the forefront of companies’ planning.Businesses around the world are shutting down under local, state or national decrees as COVID-19 fears bring caution regarding public gatherings. Unsurprisingly, hackers have used the unprecedented opportunity of chaos and panic to probe weaknesses in information technology systems. One of those systems happened to be the United States Department of Health and Human Services, making the act even more egregious, considering the circumstances.But the problem extends beyond hackers and threats to companies and individuals. During times of crisis, civil liberties also come under threat, and cryptography often provides a shield against unwarranted encroaches by the government.So, whether you’re a business worried about paying server and security costs during this economic turmoil or an individual protecting your digital assets, cryptography can serve you well.Hackers will continue to be opportunisticIt’s an unfortunate byproduct of crises, but hackers can wield social, economic and financial chaos for their gain.For example, hackers launched a distributed denial of service attack against the Department of Health and Human Services last month in a bid to slow down the COVID-19 response. The current narrative makes the hack seem distinctly malicious in its effort to make the pandemic response slower, but there is likely more to the story.The surging number of cases and by extension the hoarding of medical data under a consolidated government system presents an opportunity for hackers to abscond with sensitive information. Moreover, when emergency responses elicit rapid reactions, much of the system’s security may be a patchwork of protocols not backend tested thoroughly.For example, cases being uploaded from the field — such as hospitals, makeshift testing centers, etc. — to government servers that aggregate and display current COVID-19 metrics may contain serious security flaws due to the rapidity of their development. Applications developed by small teams to assist doctors in times of crisis may also not follow security standards, specifically the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — commonly referred to as HIPAA — compliance laws, which are esoteric and outside the scope of most technology-focused engineers.Hackers, looking for medical data that can be sold at a high value on black markets, likely view this as a gold mine. The hacking incident against the Health Department is probably not the first, nor will it be the last, of ongoing attempts to infiltrate prominent security systems.Cryptography provides a useful layer of defense against such intrusions. Masking medical data identifiers and other sensitive information is possible with a variety of cryptographic standards available today. Many projects in the crypto sector explicitly focus on financial applications, but the cryptographic modules for protecting and verifying sensitive data translate to other industries, such as healthcare, very well.That’s not to say that cryptography is a panacea to the ongoing fallout of COVID-19. In some cases, governments are covertly using the dilemma as a method to subvert encryption entirely, such as is occurring in the U.S.Government surveillance covertly gaining favor among amid crisisHidden behind all of the headlines about the Federal Reserve interest rate, the S&P 500 tanking and COVID-19 cases was a proposed legislation effort that has profound consequences on the field of cryptography.Known as the EARN IT bill, U.S. Congresspeople have proposed a bill that would effectively grant the U.S. government the ability to access “any digital message.” The bill would create a consortium of law enforcement agencies headed by the Justice Department that would institute a standard verification mechanism for any digital message. If the message does not use the standard “verification” of the government’s technology to authenticate the message, then the sending/receiving parties can be sued into oblivion.Concerning cryptography, this is a disastrous bill. The proposed document cleverly avoids the explicit use of the word “encryption,” but its language indicates that cryptography would become illegal, as all messages cannot be private between two counterparties. The government gets a backdoor.Encryption would become illegal by default because it preserves privacy and authentication of a message between two parties, preventing the ability of a third party to snoop on the message’s contents.The bill is still in its early stages, but it shows, once again, that governments do not approve of widespread encryption use among the public. Whether it be the Clipper chip scandal of the 1990s or the subversive move by Congress that is masked by a national crisis, the government’s efforts are persistent.Fortunately, cryptography — which is empirically just math — does not adhere to the caprices of hackers, governments or opportunities to subvert its influence. The grassroots encryption movement started by cypherpunks and bolstered by the crypto community has spread the technology to an extent that is unlikely to fade away at fiat decree.For businesses enduring the turbulent COVID-19 situation, don’t forget to account for your security during these vulnerable times. As individuals, remember that cryptography is your friend in protecting your civil liberties during a public health crisis.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Dr. Huang Lin is the co-founder and CTO of Suterusu, a project developing trustless privacy technology.

In the interview, published on April 3, Zilgalvis talked about the benefits and challenges of the technology.According to him, blockchain provides a powerful framework for data sharing, something that can't be done by normal databases:“We think that it presents an excellent technology for situations where different stakeholders need to collaborate but, due to competition or legal reasons, they do not want to or are unable to share a single database.”He added that blockchain is not “the solution for everything,” but there are applications such as document certification, self-sovereign identities and regulatory reporting, where DLT is “30% to 80% more efficient.”Sharing data between members of a groupThe distributed nature of blockchain is especially useful in the context of the EU, where it provides a way of coordinating data between member countries without sending it to a central location in Brussels or Luxembourg. This is the rationale behind the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, which aims to bring public services into a pan-European context. One of the potential uses of EBSI is connecting European banks in terms of their regulatory reporting, for example by sharing client data gathered in their anti-money laundering efforts.Zilgalvis noted that this is a bigger challenge than it may seem, as banks are reluctant to do so due to concerns about competition and user privacy regulations.The European blockchain effort is finding more issues with the political aspect rather than technological, as Zilgalvis revealed:“The biggest challenge is governance. The best use cases for blockchain are where it is not one enterprise or entity but many. Thus, governance is important.”On the technology side, efforts are being made to improve scaling, consensus mechanisms and privacy.Blockchain and cryptoUnlike some other governments, namely China, the European Union’s blockchain efforts are also coupled with a relaxed stance on cryptocurrencies, according to Zilgalvis""“We haven’t made any moves to prohibit anything, which stands against the stereotype of ‘if it moves, Europe regulates it.’”He added that crypto is regulated through the same principles as any currency and that any future changes will be “very much done in a ‘pro-innovation’ spirit.” European countries are indeed traditionally open to crypto, with recent examples of favorable treatment being found in both France and Germany.The European Central Bank is also pushing for issuing a “digital Euro” in response to Libra and similar worldwide initiatives. Zilgalvis, while noting that this is not EC’s area of competence, urged the bank to determine the advantages and risks of the proposal. He added:“Obviously for the EC, and the EBSI initiative, it would be easiest for us to use the euro in our blockchain infrastructure rather than another digital currency or cryptocurrency.”"
42492, YouTube Bans Drive Cryptocurrency Fans to Decentralized Alternatives ,2020-04-03t13:42:00+01:00,3928,173,"In recent years, Google-owned video-sharing platform YouTube deleted and banned an array of cryptocurrency-related channels. The platform’s policy has driven cryptocurrency enthusiasts to look for decentralized alternatives to YouTube, which allow users to skirt censorship and even incentivize them with their own tokens.In a YouTube video published on April 1, a channel dubbed Bitcoin for Beginners reviewed some of the decentralized YouTube alternatives. When choosing the most relevant platforms, the channel host took into account their usability, track records and user interface as major criteria.Among the most popular decentralized video sharing platforms, the author noted LBRY, Bitchute, BitTube, PeerTube and Dtube.LBRYLBRY has a community-controlled blockchain protocol and enables users to mine library credits and send them as tips to various creators. However, it is not easy to find good content as the platform doesn’t lay out popular or trending videos before you start following a channel.BitTubeLaunched in 2018, BitTube allows users to overpass censorship thanks to InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). BitTube appears to be more entertaining as it offers livestreams, games, groups, and other options. Moreover, the platform has a reward system, wherein it rewards creators and viewers based on the time watched, and provides two privacy tokens.BitchuteBitchute claims to use a peer-to-peer WebTorrent technology, however, the service still can delist content as it comes from their centralized servers. Also, most of the content is heavily political.DTubeAnother platform called DTube is built on IPFS and the STEEM blockchain and rewards its users with DTC tokens, which gives them an ad-free option. The last platform mentioned, Peertube, was launched in 2015 and is based on the WebTorrent technology. Peertube features P2P video sharing.In a bid to stand up to Google for censoring cryptocurrency-related content across its platforms, the crypto community started a petition in early March. The so-called #ForkGoogle memorandum accuses the tech giant of waging “campaigns of suppression against Bitcoin and blockchain industry for years.”#ForkGoogle calls for the crypto community to boycott Google’s services and migrate to alternative decentralized platforms like blogging platform Steemit and open-source browser Brave."
42490, Bithumb Global Launches Margin Trading for Bitcoin and Ether Pairs with Tether ,2020-04-03t13:19:00+01:00,1750,72,"Bithumb Global, the international platform of South Korea’s top crypto exchange, has rolled out margin trading with 5x leverage for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading pairs with Tether (USDT).In an announcement published on April 2, the exchange revealed the service would be available on its website and app. It will, however, be restricted for traders living in jurisdictions where margin trading is prohibited or capped — as, for example, with Japan.Leveraged trading gains traction in the industryMargin trading enables traders to use borrowed funds in order to increase their potential profits, yet it is a high-risk strategy, as it can equally compound losses where unsuccessful.Many platforms and regulators therefore advise, or intervene, against retail traders engaging in leveraged trading — often restricting the option to accredited or institutional investors.Briefly hinting at this, Bithumb Global urges traders to keep their strategies “appropriate” to their financial situation, in light of the “significant risks” they are courting.In late March, major crypto exchange Binance announced it was delisting FTX leveraged token pairs, just weeks after launching the products. In this case, the exchange reported that retail traders did not appear to understand the tokens and appeared to be holding rather than trading them, counter to their specific design.Binance — like OKEx and others — offers high leverage on derivatives such as futures, where complexity and liquidation risks need to be carefully navigated.In January, the 12th-largest crypto exchange Bitstamp partnered with crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank to trial leveraged Bitcoin trading, restricting the pilot to select institutional clients.Yesterday, the National Internet Finance Association of China accused overseas crypto exchanges of intentionally shutting off their systems or staging outages to trap and liquidate leverage traders during times of peak volatility."
42489," Google Chrome Leads the Pack, but Privacy-Oriented Browsers Gain Traction ",2020-04-03t13:08:00+01:00,1873,98,"In recent months, big-name players like Google and Apple have been going the extra mile to showcase their privacy features to the world. However, as most people are now aware, these multinational companies have business models that are centered around collecting and aggregating the data of their customers.In this regard, growing interest in privacy-first browsers like Brave clearly suggests a collective increase in internet users’ concern over how their personal information is being accumulated, stored and utilized on a day-to-day basis.Individuals all over the globe have become so accustomed to using free search, chat, video and other web services that they rarely understand the repercussions, especially in terms of how they are sacrificing their privacy. The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal, along with other data hacks, has shed light on the potential nefarious uses of data collection.Expounding his views on the matter, John Jefferies, the chief financial analyst at the crypto and blockchain forensics firm CipherTrace, told Cointelegraph that privacy concerns make users shift to decentralized platforms and privacy-oriented browsers, adding:“The topic of online privacy is even more relevant now that millions more people are working remotely due to work-from-home orders in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. It is incumbent upon virtual video and web communications platforms to convey data collection, privacy practices, and security options so that remote workers understand the implications of relying on these tools for virtual meetings in which sensitive information is discussed and frequently recorded.”The top web browsers in the market todayChromeDespite the criticism Google has faced in recent years for indulging in various user data distribution malpractices, the company’s Chrome web browser is still by far one of the most used internet surfing platforms in the world today. However, despite all of this negative backlash, Jun Hao Tan — the senior vice president and co-founder of the Zilliqa blockchain platform — believes that it would be misguided to disregard the efforts that big-name companies are implementing in relation to their browsers.Tan opined that one can actually argue that many of today’s mainstream browsers have started employing even more stringent privacy-preserving enhancements in the face of data privacy regulations. For example, Google Chrome recently announced that it would be phasing out third-party cookies by 2022 and has proposed a “Privacy Sandbox” with more privacy-oriented application programming interfaces for advertisers to consider for the future. Tan further added:“When it comes to decentralization and embracing open-source software, Chrome or to be more specific, Chromium — Google’s open-source browser software project — ranks highly. In fact, Chromium has since then been adopted by many other browsers such as privacy-oriented blockchain-based browser Brave and a newer version of Microsoft Edge. However, as Chrome is led by a commercial company there may be conflicts of interest.”FirefoxSimilarly, other mainstream players like Safari and Firefox have also been making notable advancements when it comes to blocking third-party cookies by default, as well as preventing websites and advertisers from engaging in cross-site tracking of their users’ web movements.According to W3Schools’s browser use statistics, Mozilla Firefox is one of the most loved web browsers in the world today. In fact, many consider Mozilla's introduction of Firefox as a key driver for why open-source browsers have increased in popularity over the years.Talking about the utility of this platform, Anna Tutova, the CEO of the crypto consulting agency Coinstelegram, told Cointelegraph that she personally is a big fan of Firefox because it offers a high level of security while also providing its users with a host of advanced features, such as pop-up blocking, a private browsing mode, as well as protection against fingerprinting, tracking, and malware and phishing attempts.A somewhat similar outlook is shared by Caleb Chen, an author for Private Internet Access’s Privacy News Online blog. He told Cointelegraph that many of the extensions and add-ons that are freely available with Firefox have made it quite easy for users to access parts of the decentralized internet. Even when it comes to crypto integration, he pointed out that Firefox presents its users with a whole host of cryptocurrency wallets that can be installed with a few clicks, either as extensions or add-ons.OperaOpera is a highly popular web browser that has been able to amass a truly global following in recent years. Additionally, on March 30, Opera became the first major surfing platform to grant users access to decentralized web pages through its partnership with Unstoppable Domains.Among traditional browsers, it is by far one of the most advanced in terms of crypto integration, since the company recently launched a blockchain browser called Opera Touch that comes with its very own built-in crypto wallet.Providing his insights regarding the privacy and security potential of Opera, Ankit Bhatia, the CEO of Sapien Network — a democratized social platform built for user privacy and customizability — told Cointelegraph that Opera’s recent integration of the InterPlanetary File System protocol has been a big step forward when it comes to maximizing individual privacy. Technically speaking, IPFS is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data through the use of a distributed file system.Charles Hamel, the head of crypto at Opera, told Cointelegraph that Opera’s vision from the very beginning has been to take care of its users’ data privacy and security. On the subject, he added: “For this reason, even if you aren’t accessing the decentralized web, you can use our built-in VPN or tracker blocker to protect yourself.” Similarly, commenting on the steps the company has been taking in regard to crypto-enabled technologies, Hamel pointed out:“The first challenge to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies we saw and fixed was: a lack of user-friendly wallet solutions or browsers which would provide native blockchain support. We have solved this problem with our native Crypto Wallet, built into the browser (mobile and desktop). The second one was the difficulty of obtaining crypto. We have also fixed that by providing seamless crypto wallet top ups in our browser.”With that being said, some critics have pointed out that since Opera is a Chinese-based company, there may be certain privacy-related issues that spring up in the future, especially with the Asian powerhouse’s pro-censorship stance.BraveJust a few years ago, the name Brave would not have elicited any response from internet users. However, according to recent data, the privacy-oriented web browser has now surpassed the 10 million monthly active users mark. In fact, according to a tweet published on April 1 by the company’s head of marketing, Des Martin, the browser’s user tally increased by more than a million people in March alone. Not only that, the platform has also been able to consolidate a creator pool of about 340,000 individuals, thereby leading many experts to believe that Brave has now entered the mainstream.When it comes to an internet-surfing platform that provides users with a healthy mix of privacy and decentralization, many experts believe that Brave is a highly palatable option. As an open-source browser, Brave not only blocks malicious advertisements and trackers but also rewards publishers through its native Ethereum-based Basic Attention Token (BAT) that powers its blockchain-based digital advertising ecosystem. In addition to all this, the browser also comes with a crypto wallet that accommodates a whole host of popular digital assets, such as Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC).In regard to why the market has responded so positively toward Brave, CEO and co-founder Brendan Eich told Cointelegraph that over the past couple of years, he has seen a privacy wave that has fueled the growth of various privacy-oriented apps. He noted: “More and more users are becoming aware that once their data is harvested by the cloud, they lose ownership and control.” However, he did concede that despite onboarding new users, retention is a key challenge, adding:“So we keep innovating and improving on Chrome compatibility with much greater than Chrome performance due to Brave’s shields. This translates into larger circles of adoption, and also into more partnerships and ecosystem growth. As more and more decentralized apps grow and collaborate, a new landscape will represent a viable alternative to the current broken model.”Related: Brave New World: Browser Challenging Google for the Future of PrivacyCommenting on the browser’s growing popularity, Tan pointed out that one of the key reasons why Brave has been able to capture the attention of the masses is because it recently joined the AdLedger consortium, which has many leading advertising and media giants as members, including Publicis, GroupM and IBM. Not only that, HTC also recently selected Brave as the default browser for its blockchain smartphone, Exodus. Tan further added:“Brave is also lauded for its emphasis on speed, largely enabled by its ‘ad-stripping’ strategy which means it downloads comparatively less content from websites than any other mainstream browser on the market today.”On the subject, Billy Rennekamp, the grants manager for the Interchain Foundation — an organization that seeks to advance the use of open, decentralized network technologies — told Cointelegraph that the team behind Brave has done a great job maximizing its browser’s ability to block ads and web trackers, as well as in offering its users access to the Tor network.SafariAt one point in time, Apple’s Safari was one of the world’s most widely used internet browsers. However, the platform has in recent years lost a lot of its users to other more efficient options, such as Firefix, Chrome, Brave and others. In fact, Safari was initially known for its ability to block third-party cookies by default, thus preventing websites and advertisers from engaging in cross-site tracking of user behaviors online.That being said, Safari is a close-source project — only the WebKit portion of the platform is open-source based — and thus its overall capacity to provide users with certain decentralization and privacy-related features is quite constrained.TorOver the last decade or so, Tor’s global popularity seems to have increased dramatically. For starters, it is one of the most privacy-oriented browsers that one can make use of today. It not only prevents third-party trackers from keeping tabs on an individual’s surfing habits, but it also automatically clears one’s cookies and data history.Furthermore, from a technical standpoint, Tor encrypts an individual’s traffic three times using three different nodes, all of which are decentralized and operated by volunteers. Each node peels away only one layer of encryption, so the full message cannot be accessed by an individual operator. All of this, however, results in slower surfing speeds.Unfortunately, the Tor network has some dark associations with it as well, especially since the browser has been used by miscreants to access a whole host of darknet marketplaces where it is possible to acquire and trade illegal items, such as drugs, firearms, etc.StatusAn up-and-coming name in the world of decentralized web browsing, Status has been gaining widespread traction among users looking to secure their digital data in the easiest manner possible. Status offers users a three-in-one platform that includes a messenger, crypto wallet and Web 3.0 browser. Speaking on the technological capabilities of this software, Rennekamp stated:“I think Status has made privacy and decentralization core to their offering as a crypto product and it shows. Mostly through their work on Vac, the open protocol for decentralized and encrypted chat, but also through their support of the Ethereum Name Service.”He further pointed out that the team behind Status recently launched its first public release, Whisper, which is an open protocol for decentralized and encrypted chat that was developed by blockchain auditor and Solidity developer Dean Eigenmann.MetaMask extensionWhile not a pure browsing application in and of itself, MetaMask is a browser extension that is fully compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Opera. Additionally, the add-on also comes with a native crypto wallet that is extremely popular among digital currency owners worldwide.Simply put, MetaMask provides users with one of the simplest and most secure ways to connect with various blockchain-based applications.Will the future of internet browsing be privacy-oriented?Despite big-name companies like Google continually pushing the narrative that they are looking to maximize the privacy of their users, the situation appears to be the exact opposite, especially since smaller players like Brave have been able to amass a large following in recent years.In this regard, it seems as though there is a shift in market perception taking place when it comes to individual privacy and security, such that more and more people are beginning to move from centralized web browsing services like Microsoft Edge to more decentralized and transparent ones. On the issue, Bhatia said that he does not believe Google when it talks about prioritizing privacy, adding:“I hope Brave and Opera make enough noise about their privacy features. There’s a strong potential to change perceptions about privacy and how users view their web browsers. Brave’s growth trajectory means there’s room for a major private browser in the market.”And while Rennekamp believes that Google will most likely maintain a lead within the market segment, players like Brave and Opera have the potential to push the conversation in a more privacy-oriented direction. Similarly, Chen also believes that as time goes on and people become more tech savvy, their preference for transparent, auditable and incorruptible (decentralized and distributed) internet tools will slowly but surely grow."

As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $6,989, up over 4.6% over the past 24 hours at press time, according to Coin360.Novogratz loves making predictionsThis is not the first time that Novogratz made an optimistic prediction about Bitcoin. In fact, Novogratz is known for making some inaccurate Bitcoin price forecasts alongside major industry bulls like Tim Draper and John McAfee.Last year, the Galaxy Digital CEO argued that institutional interest would push the Bitcoin price back to $20,000 before the end of 2019."

The study estimated that varying degrees of intervention could reduce the number of deaths to between 12,000 and 48,000.“For the sake of the healthcare workers on the front lines and the millions of lives at risk, we need a concerted effort so we want to invite the broader blockchain and crypto communities to join us in our fight against COVID-19,” Sun added. Huobi Indonesia builds online donation portalHuobi’s Indonesian subsidiary has also developed an online portal for fiat and crypto donations to ICAESCC. Huobi Indonesia is slated to work with ICAESCC to administrate and promote the platform, and distribute medical supplies. The portal is available in English, Chinese, and Indonesian.Huobi Charity plans to launch a similar initiative in New York — which now has more than 83,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases.Huobi doubles down on Indonesia Indonesia is the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasts the largest economy in Southeast Asia.Huobi Indonesia is one of just three national subsidiaries operated by Huobi Global, alongside exchanges targeting South Korea and Russian respectively.Despite producing relatively low trade volume when compared to Korea and Russia, Huobi Charity’s initiative highlights the importance of the Indonesian market to the exchange.Huobi Indonesia comprises the second-largest Indonesian exchange by volume — generating roughly $2.25 million in trade from 29 pairings over the past 24 hours."

42482, Brazilian Regulators Create DLT Platform for Screening Politicians ,2020-04-03t11:28:00+01:00,1468,77,"Four of Brazil’s financial regulatory institutions are collaborating to build a streamlined blockchain-based data-sharing platform to perform background checks on political representatives and corporations.The platform, dubbed PIER, was developed by Brazil’s central bank Banco Central do Brasil (BCB). The platform saw initial participation from the BCB, the Brazilian private insurance superintendent, and the local securities regulator to inform its database.Brazil’s social security supervisor is set to soon participate in the program too. The Brazilian government is also contemplating incorporating data collected by the country’s judiciary, trade boards, and international financial bodies into the PIER system.Brazilian regulators use DLT to streamline dataDaniel Bichuette, the deputy head of the BCB’s financial system organization department, describes the streamlining of inter-departmental data as “drastically reducing"" the time to evaluate the financial background of an entity.Institutions querying the PIER database are able to quickly access data ""from punitive processes and restrictions from companies and administrators,” an entity’s “history of performance in the financial system” — including technical capacity and organization conduct, and “information on the participation of individuals and legal entities in the share capital and shareholding control.”Adalberto Felinto da Cruz Júnior, the executive secretary of the central bank, described the partnership as having been a “particularly fruitful” endeavor that has paved the way for “important synergies” between the participating regulatory authorities.Blockchain technologies reduce opportunities for corruptionEduardo Weller, a software specialist with the BCB stated that using distributed ledger technology for PIER allows the use of “a decentralized, tested technology, whose native functionalities mean that there is no need to build the system from scratch.”Weller emphasizes that digital signatures guarantee the “authenticity of messages exchanged""; the “integrity of data recorded,” and “eliminates a single point of failure [and] central entity that can defraud data.”PIER has undergone roughly two years of development, having first been revealed by the central bank in June 2018."

In a tweet on April 2, he thanked those working on the frontline against the virus, and also called for recovered patients to donate blood for use in antibody transplants.Larsen had not publicly shared the fact that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The majority of the crypto-community only discovered the truth when he posted his tweet, accompanied by a picture of himself wearing a facemask giving a thumbs-up gesture.Recovered patients can still help the sickDespite his recent recovery from the illness, Larsen was keen to encourage others who have recovered to help those still suffering by donating blood.The blood of those who have successfully fought off the disease contains antibodies. Through a blood transfusion, these can help very ill patients to fight off the virus, even before they start to produce antibodies of their own.Chris Larsen co-founded Ripple and was CEO of the company until stepping down in November 2016.

42476, Revolut Fast-Tracks User-Wide Crypto Support Due to Global Economic Upset ,2020-04-03t09:57:00+01:00,1817,86,"Digital banking app Revolut has rolled out its cryptocurrency services for all standard users, saying it is widening access earlier than planned due to the global economic crisis.In an email to users on April 1, the United Kingdom-born fintech announced that cryptocurrency accounts and trading — previously reserved from Premium and Metal tier users of the app — are as of now available for all standard users, at a 1.5% flat fee per trade.A warning “right now”Amid the unprecedented economic turbulence sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, Revolut cautions its users that “we are starting to see quantitative easing and currency devaluation happening again right now,” adding:“We had planned to make this official later this year, but in light of recent events, we’ve decided to give all Revolut customers the opportunity to explore different ways of diversifying, including through crypto, right now.”Revolut’s head of crypto Edward Cooper noted that the impetus for crypto's creation was sparked, in part, by the fallout of the 2008 financial crash — an era marked, as now, by an economic recession, fiat currency volatility and the rise of quantitative easing (QE).While controversial, QE — the large-scale buying of government bonds by central banks — has become a routine monetary tool for crisis management post-2008.QE is intended to lower yields (interest rates) on the bond market in order to encourage spending by making it cheaper to borrow money, thus providing a stimulus for growth in the economy.Critics of QE are prevalent in the crypto industry — though they are by no means limited to it.Caitlin Long, the founder of the United States’ first crypto-native bank, Avanti Bank and Trust, has responded to the Federal Reserve’s 2020 pledge to continue the policy, claiming that:“The last vestige of #capitalism [has] died in the U.S. [The] Fed’s monetization U.S. debt is now unlimited. Nationalization of US capital mkts — a process started in 1968 — is now complete. This result was predictable (virus was just trigger).”Revolut’s journey with cryptoAs reported, Revolut had first rolled out support for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) in late 2017, later adding XRP.By February of this year, the app had grown to become one of Europe’s most valuable fintech firms. Last month, Revolut launched in the U.S. — though initially without crypto support.In an email to Cointelegraph, Dave Hodgson — co-founder and director of NEM ventures — said that while Revolut’s broadening of support for crypto represents “a positive step for the industry”:“It would be encouraging to see Revolut (and others) fully adopt the crypto philosophy 'not your keys, not your coins' and not assume that all users want a custodial solution.”While fees for standard users of the app’s crypto feature will initially have parity with Premium and Metal users, at 1.5%, the flat fee for standard users will rise to 2.5% in May.Revolut will also be making gold trading available to standard users by the end of this month."
42473," Blockchain Is Not a Panacea for Finance, Says Russian Bank Official ",2020-04-03t08:48:00+01:00,1881,75,"The Central Bank of Russia’s (CBR) first deputy governor has said that blockchain technology is not the ""universal solution,"" many promised it would be five years ago.In an interview with Euromoney on April 2, Olga Skorobogatova took a deep dive into the bank’s initiatives, sandboxes, and experiences with blockchain deployment.Following three years of experimenting with the Masterchain platform — a local blockchain-based network for transferring valuable financial data like mortgage accounting — Skorobogatova said, “Blockchain is a great fit for things like letters of credit and guarantees because it is essentially a technology of trust.”However, she further added that blockchain is not the cure-all that many believed it would be:“I remember being told by some tech companies back then: ‘Olga, in five years everything will be powered by blockchain, there will be no other technologies.' I responded that this technology would work in cases when it would create additional value but not as a substitution for everything. Time has proven me right.”But what about cryptocurrencies?Skorobogatova said she does not believe in cryptocurrencies as a means of payment as they pose major risks for customers. She noted cryptocurrencies’ high volatility, lack of guarantee for savings, and usage in money laundering as major threats.The deputy governor noted that the central bank is in talks with other regulators on the issue of global stablecoins, stating that, at this point, stablecoins raise more questions than answers.The CBR has flirted with the idea of a national digital currency, which Skorobogatova questions as well:“For me, the big question is if there is any added value in using central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) – for the economy, for individuals and for businesses. Clearly, people want fast digital payments, but this can be implemented with a national fast payments platform. What can CBDCs bring to the table? So far, no one in Russia or elsewhere has been able to give a convincing answer or even to explain the difference between electronic payments and CBDCs.”Russia’s recent approach to crypto and blockchain regulationMeanwhile, Russia has postponed its bill “On Digital Financial Assets” yet again. Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets and chairman of the National Banking Council at the CBR, admitted that previous delays in the bill’s adoption were caused by disagreement on the new asset type between local authorities.Aksakov said that the central bank opposed the legalization of crypto while the State Duma advocated some crypto initiatives.On March 24, the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia reportedly prepared a draft law that would allow the testing of cryptocurrency and blockchain developments within a special regulatory sandbox."
42471, Is Blockchain Necessary? An Unbiased Perspective ,2020-04-03t08:37:00+01:00,1781,134,"Yes, that’s the question we are asking today. Is blockchain technology necessary? The answer is tricky. To arrive at the conclusion takes an unbiased perspective. Bankers and people in the stock market will tell you that it’s the epitome of evil. Blockchain engineers and enthusiasts will tell you it’s the future of the world. The government, as usual, will be indecisive.Both are overly eager in their opinions, and both are unfortunately wrong. Blockchain is wonderful and revolutionary, no doubt there. But it has some very serious cons that are underplayed by people supporting blockchain. It also has excellent pros underplayed by its critics.To the enthusiasts, I contextually quote Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park:“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”To the critics, I contextually quote J.P. Getty (a terribly frugal person, in my opinion):“In times of rapid change, experience could be your worst enemy.”We’re done with fancy quotes. Time to move on. Coming back to blockchain, the tech was created to make cryptocurrency easier to manage, and it is an excellent technology.A mini blockchain explanationTo those who still do not understand what blockchain is, I’ll give you a simple example.A blockchain is a continuous line of data “blocks.” Think of a single block in blockchain as a digital Lego piece and the organization using it as a kid’s daycare place. The Lego piece is available for use to everyone for whatever they want to create. It is ever-present and ever-useful. It is accessible. The Lego piece can be attached to other Lego pieces to create masterpieces of art.A blockchain works similarly. Singularly, it’s just some encrypted data. Each data block together can create masterpieces of data available whenever a user wants. Just like Legos, that singular piece is hard to break, overpower or destroy. It’s a pain in the foot. You know, because they destroy you when you step on them. Okay! I’m done with the puns.They can be extremely useful. Combined with machine learning, blockchain can single-handedly make the entire banking industry obsolete. Blockchain can be used scientifically for complex mathematical calculations and help with complex problems in physics. It can help forward gene therapy. To be honest, blockchain can theoretically go full Star Wars. That brings me to the first con — never go full Star Wars. Didn’t work out well for anyone.Discussions on blockchain’s various applicationsThe democratic angle:I’ve seen some enthusiasts argue how blockchain is the “epitome of democracy.” It allows everyone access to the same data and it’s fair. To this, I have a single counterpoint: Imagine if Google made their servers public or your 401k balance was made public to the world. How would that affect things? Privacy and secrecy are important things. Most of all, keeping data out of other people’s hands is also necessary.You may not do much with it, but the greatest threat faced by the modern world is a lack of privacy. It’s already getting to a breaking point. People are long since annoyed by targeted marketing and Cambridge Analytica remains a huge example of how bad things can be. Facebook is almost constantly under fire and Google has followed right behind on a breadcrumb-scattered trail of lawsuits. Blockchain, unregulated, can make humanity’s struggle with deteriorating privacy even worse.Unregulated blockchain is a nightmarish scenario come true. However, how do you regulate blockchain? How do you put laws in place for a technology whose capabilities we barely understand? By the time we learn of its capabilities, it may be too late to affect change.The banking angle:Bankers hate blockchain. It’s obvious why they would; the greatest advantage of blockchain is that it cuts down on costs, only requiring infrastructure costs. No transaction fees, no maintenance charges, nothing. Effectively, blockchain makes banking obsolete, and honestly, I feel it should. The banking industry has remained unchanged over millennia. It is an integral part of society whose mismanaged monetary transactions have incited myriad wars.Unfortunately, the banking industry is in a pathetic state. Bankers have too much power, control and streams of revenue. It needs to topple. It’s a legacy system, and the pain points of this system haven’t changed since the days of Venetian merchants. There is so much abuse of power involved, and the fact that it is legal paints a grim picture.For example, the man who invented the credit card never wanted interest rates to go over 8%. Today, banks on average charge from 12% to 18% not including transaction, processing and various other fees.Blockchain can destroy and recreate this system. However, this brings us to the greatest chink in blockchain’s armor: This transformative process is expensive and decentralized. Hate it if you want, but a decentralized system is hard to control. Decentralizing banks means facilitating illegal activities like money laundering, illegal purchases and so on. It is never a good thing.The analysis angle:I have mentioned above that blockchain combined with machine learning is good at analysis. Just two words: Cambridge Analytica.Blockchain makes it easier for similar stuff to happen. What’s worse is you won’t be able to blame anyone. Blockchain’s data integrity makes it so that everyone is responsible. So, if one part of the network messes up, everyone is compromised.Similarly, stock market firms are using blockchain for insane investment schemes with unrealistic returns. This can lead to massive stock market crashes and overvaluation of stock to unprecedented levels.The Utopia angle:Unlimited access to data can also be a wonderful thing. Imagine that you want to know what your cereal contains. No more secrecy, the answer is right there in your data store. A simple search and you know. Supply chains, fair trade and ethical consumerism are attractive opportunities. Blockchain can create an online utopia if done right. The access to information is an interesting prospect.For example, imagine an app made with an app builder software backed by blockchain. The blockchain would help make it faster to create apps making the app development process easier for everyone to use. Widgets and plugins would be available in the form of the universally available data blocks. Adapting to new changes becomes easier. This can be similarly applied to any business process. There can potentially be block chains for everything.The anonymous angle:Blockchain can make you anonymous. Anonymity is the need of the hour. Imagine voting anonymously, with governments and candidates not knowing who’s voting who. It is a wonderful thing. Similarly, maintaining freedom of the press in sensitive areas becomes easier. Anonymity is what made the internet popular, and it is likely to take it ahead.VerdictSo, if you ask again, “Is blockchain necessary?” — the answer is: “Yes. But with certain limitations.”The coupling of blockchain and machine learning should be restricted. Yes, that limits its usability but sometimes taking a step back is a good thing, especially when it comes to data. After all, we don’t really have a good track record of managing data.An overhaul in the banking industry and a step toward ethical consumerism are all good things that blockchain brings for us. However, it would be better to take it slow. I do see that the slow and steady way is not happening, as rapid adoption is under progress.

42470," Staked Token Supply Doesn’t Correlate with Price, Says Messari Analyst ",2020-04-03t08:28:00+01:00,1360,52,"As cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, crypto players can’t stop arguing about what really impacts the price of certain coins and what does not.Some crypto pundits believe a larger amount of tokens staked in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains could push the price upwards by reducing the circulating supply, making the remaining tokens more valuable. But blockchain and crypto analytics firm Messari has crunched the numbers and reports that there is little correlation between the two.Announcements correlate with price thoughIn an April 1 blog post, Wilson Withiam, a researcher at the Messari analytics team, provided an analysis of 21 popular staking networks like Cosmos (ATOM) and Tezos (XTZ) in order to examine the level of correlation between the amount of staked tokens and price changes.He found prices of the analyzed tokens are actually more correlated with project-related announcements than the amount of liquid supply of staked tokens.Cosmos (ATOM) experienced the most significant price drop among the analyzed networks in 2020 despite having the highest staking total of more than 90%. The situation was affected by internal issues involving the shift of the company’s priorities amid multiple departures, the researcher added.In contrast, Dash (DASH), which saw one of the biggest price upsurges among the analyzed tokens over a year-to-date period, has fewer tokens staked. According to the analyst, the token was rather more impacted by a March 2020 announcement about its new Dash v0.11 platform release. Indeed, Dash was among the top performers, with its price surging nearly 40% over a week in March after the Dash Core Group released significant updates for its platform, as Cointelegraph reported.Percentage of supply staked compared to change in price. Source: MessariWhat is staking and why is it believed to impact crypto prices?Staking is the process of holding crypto funds to support operations of a blockchain network. Staking is similar to earning dividends or interest on an investment as users receive staking rewards.Unlike Bitcoin’s (BTC) original Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, which is based on miners’ work, the PoS algorithm operates depending on a validator's stake in the network. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH) is expected to shift from PoW algorithm to PoS consensus in 2020 which has increased the amount of attention on staking recently. Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has been expanding its staking products since it launched its own dedicated staking platform in September 2019."
42469, Bitcoin Price Holds $6.8K Defying Predictions of Testing New Lows ,2020-04-03t08:20:00+01:00,5720,67,"On Thursday, April 2, Bitcoin (BTC) price continued the rally it started in the late evening on Wednesday.As reported earlier by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin price briefly consolidated around $6,650 before breaking out to tackle the $6,900 resistance and as predicted in a previous analysis, the price quickly rose to $7,200 before pulling back sharply.Crypto market daily price chart. Source: Coin360Analysts are calling for a retest of lower support at $5,800-$5,800 but at the moment traders continue to buy into dips and this is resulting in the price holding $6,800. Given that the price has lately taken to bouncing off the ascending trendline a retest of underlying support at $6,600 and $6,330 seems more likely.BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe volume profile visible range (VPVR) shows a volume gap from $6,540-$6,370 so if Bitcoin fails to hold the $6,600 support the former support at $6,400 is less likely to hold. A surge in sell volume would likely lead to the price slicing through this zone and possibly through the high volume node at $6,330, hence the call by analysts for the price to revisit to the support at $5,800.Since pushing right to the top of the resistance cluster at $7,200 the price has notched lower highs on the 4-hour timeframe but the sell volume that quickly pulled the price from $7,200 has ebbed away and as the price pulls closer to $6,700 there is an increase in the money flow shown by the Chaikin Money Flow oscillator.The CMF is above 0 and the increase, along with the long shadows and higher lows of the last 3 candlesticks on the 4-hour timeframe show bulls are buying on the dips to support the price above $6,600. The decline in selling volume also supports this observation.BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe price is above 20-MA of the Bollinger Band indicator at $6,600, a point also aligned with the ascending trendline, and at the time of writing the 4-hour Relative Strength Index is at 66.Thus, traders can watch to see if the downward curve flattens or begins to pull up along with an increase in purchasing volume on the shorter timeframes. If this doesn’t happen then a retest of the aforementioned underlying supports seems likely.Looking forwardUltimately, the Wednesday and Thursday rallies did well to bolster Bitcoin’s momentum, allowing the cryptocurrency to push through key overhead resistances and turn a few to support.BTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewOn the daily time frame one can see that the price continues to form higher lows and even with a retest of underlying supports as low as $5,800, the price is gearing up for a retest of the $7,200 resistance where there is a high volume VPVR node.Once the price pushes through the $7,200-$7,400 zone there is a volume gap, which if exploited, would see the price rise to $7,700. While this level is close to setting a monthly higher high above $7,950, the 50,100, and 200-day moving averages are all close overhead and will likely be a challenge to overcome.While it could take longer than one expects, a move above the 100 and 200 day moving averages would signal that Bitcoin has turned bullish on a macro level and sustained trading above $8,500 would provide even stronger confirmation.For the short-term, traders can simply watch to see if the price holds above the ascending trendline and whether dips continue to be brought up as this is a sign of strength.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42467," As Hospitals Crumble, Venezuela's President Airdrops Petros to Doctors ",2020-04-03t06:24:00+01:00,6065,102,"Nicolas Maduro, a former bus driver and Venezuela’s sitting president, has announced a campaign to support his country’s medical staff amid the coronavirus pandemic by airdropping one Petro to each doctor.The ‘Doctors of the Homeland’ initiative will see each Venezuelan doctor air-dropped one of the administration’s oil-backed Petro cryptocurrency tokens, as per an April 2 tweet published by a government official.Venezuela to issue Petro bonus to doctorsThe tokens will be distributed using Venezuela’s ‘Patria System’ — a platform launched by the government to bypass the nation’s failing banking system and issue bonuses and subsidies using the cryptographic token.Petro tokens are purportedly pegged to the price of one barrel of Venezuelan oil. Following a crash down to 18-year lows during March, the price of oil has bounced 20% in the past day to currently trade for roughly $27 per barrel.Petro sees minimal adoptionWhile the Maduro administration claims that the Petro is worth roughly $60, popular trading platforms used by Venezuelans currently list the token for roughly between $20 and $26.However, with Venezuelan monthly minimum wages equating to $3.61 plus $2.89 in food stamps, and doctors estimated to earn little more, one Petro could equate to several months of work.Venezuelan hospitals crumbleMaduro might have been better off handing the Petros directly to Venezuelan Hospitals, most of which are reportedly ill-equipped to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. An April 1 Vice report describing soap and disinfectant as “luxuries” at the Caracas University Hospital.With the facility already experiencing shortages of protective equipment, many of its staff are expecting the hospital to quickly become overwhelmed as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases grows.“My fear is that we won’t have supplies next week when cases are expected to spike,” said the university’s head of infectious diseases, Maria Landaeta."

It currently connects over five million active nodes with over 92 million detected devices.While Stellar has been able to handle Nodle’s heavy traffic of 1.3 million daily transactions to date, the company believes it needs to deploy its own blockchain to accommodate some of the advanced features envisioned in its whitepaper.Nodle’s blockchain architect, Eliott Teissonniere believes that interoperability is the key to the future success of its Arcadia blockchain. It is being built on the Parity Substrate framework and employs modular design with an eye on becoming Polkadot’s parachain. Parachains are specialized blockchains that make up the Polkadot network.Nodle Cash — betting on the futureNodle Network participants earn Nodle Cash. Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency is not listed on exchanges and doesn’t have any monetary value as yet. Teissonniere told Cointelegraph:“It's a bet on the future. And essentially, they're going to be able to use it in a few weeks to interact. We are working on giving users a way to use it. For example, we will soon launch a customer interface where they will be able to set up webhooks to connect their own devices.”Nodle co-founder and CEO, Micha Benoliel explained they wanted to “build enough demand and have the ecosystem sufficiently mature before we list it.”He also noted that the company has been able to achieve “presence on almost 20 million monthly smartphones” by offering app developers Nodle Cash as compensation.Nodle Vs. IOTABenoliel believes that Nodle is a “great alternative” to IOTA and that his company’s strengths are its concrete use cases and interoperability. Although Teissonniere is reluctant to name the exact date for the release of the mainnet, he expects deployment in approximately six months.IOTA still recovering from a major hack may present Nodle with an opportunity to carve out a nice chunk of the IoT blockchain market."

The tax watchdog is also targeting those who earn income abroad and from real estate investments.Taxes don’t stop during a pandemicSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Javier Pastor, chief sales officer at Spain-based crypto exchange Bit2me, said he believes the government may be looking for ways to obtain income to help pay for the huge costs incurred during the COVID-19 crisis.Pastor pointed out the Spanish government has not postponed the filing of tax returns or the payment of taxes due to the pandemic. He said the measures would not affect Spanish exchanges much, even though he believes stricter KYC rules and transaction monitoring is on the way.“This does not affect us much in the companies in the industry that have been doing things well […] I think they [tax watchdog] are only scaring the novice user by applying such measures, plus I don't think they are going to collect much tax revenue from the cryptocurrency sector because they are not even regulated in our country.""The national tax authorities have become increasingly interested in crypto over the past couple of years, in which a series of measures were implemented to oversee tax obligations.Growing interest in crypto taxationIn 2018, Cointelegraphreported that Spain’s tax agency sent information requests for customer data to 60 companies associated with cryptocurrencies, including those firms that accepted cryptos as a payment option.

42464, Huge Rise in Chinese ‘Blockchain’ Companies — But Are They Real? ,2020-04-03t04:53:00+01:00,1935,114,"More than 35,000 blockchain companies are operating in mainland China — but it’s believed that many of them do not even use blockchain technology.In the first quarter of 2020, as COVID-19 shut down factories, offices and cities across the world, 2,383 brand-new “blockchain” companies sprung up in China.This brings the total to 35,010 companies as of April 1 — over 20,000 in Guangdong province alone — according to Tianyancha, a business data company.But in mid-February data firm LongHash estimated that approximately 70% of the total number of blockchain firms registered in the Asian country at that time had lost their legal status or had their licenses revoked.‘Blockchain’ companies in name onlyBlockchain is hot property in China, especially after President Xi Jinping announced in October last year the country will become a global blockchain power leader. This may help explain why larger businesses label themselves as “blockchain” companies when in fact they have little if anything to do with the core technology.This push, combined with how complicated it is to bring a legitimate blockchain company up to government standards, might go a long way to explaining the phenomenon.Many smaller Chinese “blockchain” companies and startups have been found to be shell corporations. A marketing tactic in and of itself, these “blockchain” companies can then be sold or absorbed by a larger, perhaps more legitimate firms.At a December 2019 Annual Meeting on Blockchain and Digital Assets in Beijing, Bai Liang, Vice Director of Chinese Institute of Digital Asset, admitted the number of these companies was astonishingly high:“The reality is that… 96% of the more than 30,000 blockchain companies in China are not actually operating [using blockchain as their core technology].”China’s Office of Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission (CAC) has reported only 506 companies out of the 35,000+ even have a blockchain service filing number."
42463, Craig Wright’s WikiLeaks Claims Contradicted by His Own 2011 Posts ,2020-04-03t04:35:00+01:00,4181,84,"In his latest blog post, Craig Wright claimed that he (as Satoshi Nakamoto) never wanted WikiLeaks to use Bitcoin. On March 31st he wrote:“I’m not the anarchist they want, nor have I ever been anything like one. You see, I didn’t want WikiLeaks to use Bitcoin because I didn’t like what they stood for.”However, publicly available web links from July 2011 suggest this was not the case. In the wake of PayPal’s decision to freeze the accounts of the non-profit WikiLeaks in 2010, Wright told commenters on his article in The Conversation that it was the foundation’s own fault for not using Bitcoin as a donation method. Wright wrote in the comments section:“If you want to look at anything to blame, look to WL's stupidity in selecting PayPal as a provider over BitCoin and others like them when PayPal is known to shy away from controversy.”The posts from 2011 lack the same targeted criticism of WikiLeaks that characterize Wright’s current blog. Wright’s article defends PayPal against the prospect of a cyber-attack from Anonymous and LulzSec, but only because he thought it was WikiLeaks’ own fault for not using Bitcoin. He claimed:“Basically, I know of over 50 alternatives to PayPal. Some are close to PayPal in size and we also have to remember that WikiLeaks was the site that selected PayPal and not one of the alternatives. WL could have selected BitCoin, but it did not.”Craig Wright loves the lawRecently, Wright said that the law is coming for Bitcoin, and that anyone who wishes to use it anonymously will be punished in the end. That’s a long way from his recommendation that WikiLeaks use the currency precisely to maintain their anonymity. Wright stated in 2011:“Bit Coin (Bit Coin) is a digital currency. Bit Coin offers a full peer-to-peer currency solution. P2P transfer of funds is available using methods that can even be untraceable. They're a ways (sic) using this technology to transfer funds that cannot be intercepted or stopped.”Craig Wright remains embroiled in a potential multi-billion dollar lawsuit with the family of former computer forensics expert, Dave Kleiman. The ongoing trial in Florida has been held up numerous times, partly by Wright’s inability to provide straightforward answers to the court."

The new legislation also allows German banks to offer cryptocurrency products.The strengthening of Germany’s crypto regulations has sparked the beginnings of a wave of institutional adoption, with 40 German banks filing applications seeking authorization to offer digital asset services by Feb. 7."
42458, Binance Research Finds Bitcoin Correlated to Stocks — But Not For Long ,2020-04-03t03:14:00+01:00,2710,90,"In a new report Binance Research found a ‘moderate’ positive correlation between Bitcoin and US equities during the first quarter of 2020 — but neither was correlated to gold.Bitcoin was down 10% over the quarter but still outperformed the S&P 500 which experienced a 19% drop. According to the report, the correlation was fairly high at 0.57, as shown through similar patterns in daily business day returns.Gold and long-term treasuries showed no relationship to other markets as they rose by 8% and 23% respectively.The good news for hodlers is that the Binance Research analysts concluded their report by stating:“Despite Bitcoin displaying a significant positive correlation with US equities in the first quarter of 2020, this high correlation coefficient remains very unlikely to persist in the medium to long term.”This mirrors the analysis by the CEO of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead, who told investors that historically speaking Bitcoin’s correlation with stock market falls only lasted for the first few months.Other correlationsBitcoin and Ethereum, demonstrated a record-high correlation with a rate of 0.93. Only a few of the major cryptocurrencies bucked this trend, such as Link and XTZ, which showed overall positive gains primarily due to project specific developments.The report feeds into the ongoing debate about whether Bitcoin is or is not an uncorrelated asset. Bitcoin proponents have been disappointed to see BTC moving in tandem with traditional markets during the crisis — though there have been some signs recently Bitcoin may be treading a more independent path.Since most altcoins are correlated to Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is correlated to traditional markets, this could imply most altcoin are indirectly correlated with traditional assets.Market crashThe crypto industry (represented by the CMC 200 index as the industry benchmark) showed strong signs of support during the first quarter, prior to the pandemic. Gains recorded in January of almost 30% were diminished by moderate negative returns in February before the market crash of 46% in mid-March from the yearly high.Immediately after the crash, the index stabilized before going on a recovery trend that has continued to date, increasing almost 30%."

Wahoo!” This triggered excitement in the crypto community, with the tweet amassing about 5,900 likes as of press time.Dye clearly didn’t expect the excitement and later elaborated:“I couldn’t have asked for a warmer welcome to the Bitcoin fold. If anything, the number of comments and likes shows thousands are invested in Bitcoin and confidence is high. Feeling even more secure in my investment, if that is possible. Thank you all!”Buying first Bitcoin is not that easyTalking to Cointelegaph, Dye revealed that she has been aware of Bitcoin for many years but only began closely following the industry in the last few months. The executive admitted that buying the first Bitcoin “wasn't the most straightforward process,” adding that she received solid advice from industry insiders. Dye added that she “would not recommend anyone invest in bitcoin blindly” without thorough research first.“I saw the purchase as a flight to safety”The ADA policy director also admitted that the ongoing economic turmoil has impacted her decision to invest in crypto. Noting that people tend to invest in gold and other precious metals during a recession due their limited supply, Dye expressed confidence that Bitcoin is a digital gold.Dye said:“The economic downturn and the corresponding dip in the value of bitcoin prompted me to action. I like to buy things when they are on sale. I also saw the purchase as a ""flight to safety."" [...] Rather than trusting in the excessive spending of politicians to uphold the value of the Australian dollar, I decided to put my money into a decentralised currency.”Amid the Australian government considering to ban cash transactions over $10,000, Dye also outlined the privacy and independence of cryptocurrencies. She noted:“While few people make $10,000 cash transactions, the limit is not tied to inflation so will slowly strangle one of the banking system's largest competitors: cash. People deserve an alternative to banks and credit card companies; without cash, cryptos are that competitor.”BTC tax situation in AustraliaThe ATA is a major activist and advocacy organization in Australia. They are committed to promoting the rights of local taxpayers, and frequently oppose over-regulation and overtaxation.

Source: Coin360The rationale behind a short-term rally to $8,500PentarhUdi, a well known technical analyst and trader who has deftly predicted multiple Bitcoin market cycles in the past, initially estimated that Bitcoin price would plunge from $10,500 to $5,800 in the first week of February.On February 10, 2020, the trader explained that based on candlestick wicks, $10,500 was technically a lower low at a macro level and given that this level was a historically heavy resistance, a drop to $5,800 was highly probable.Citing PentarUdi’s $10,500 to $5,800 prediction, crypto whale and Bitfinex trader Joe007 said:“There is one, and only one, TA analyst in the world that I really respect, and just today, a few hours ago, he came up with this piece of analysis.”Due to a significant selloff in the U.S. stock market and the worsening Coronavirus pandemic that has since swept across the U.S. and Europe, the price of Bitcoin over extended its downtrend and fell to $3,600 on crypto futures exchanges.The fact that buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip and pushed the price from $3,600 to $5,200 led PentarUdi to suggest that Bitcoin price is likely to rally to $8,500 over the short term.PentarUdi stated:“This should bounce up from weekly sma 200 ($5,200) up to daily sma 200 ($8,500). Break up of the upper trend line invalidates this bearish count. I remind this is a hypothetical bearish outcome of previously published ideas.”As a note of caution, PentarhUdi warned that as a result of the current global financial panic, Bitcoin is still likely to fall below $3,000 after rebounding past $8,000.According to the trader:“I got a bearish target between $1,800 and $2,500. In this case weekly 200 SMA will be broken and become resistance. Many times and affords will require to break it up and make it support.”BTC-USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIn short, Bitcoin price is currently seeing a relief rally to the 200-day SMA, a point which has acted as a strong resistance area throughout the past several years. Yet, there is a strong possibility that the entire rally becomes susceptible to a deep correction.The next upside move could be a fake-outWith instability in the global equities market and dire warnings from governments that the novel Coronavirus pandemic could potentially lead to increased deaths over the next several months, a recovery to $8,500 could still be a bull trap.On March 29, Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that the Coronavirus could potentially lead to 200,000 fatalities.If efforts to contain the outbreak in the U.S. and Europe fail and the development of a vaccine takes 12 to 18 months, the sentiment in crypto and equities markets could take an even deeper bearish turn."

42444, Did Apple Just Kill Crypto ‘Burner Wallets’? ,2020-04-03t00:41:00+01:00,4224,83,"Recent changes to Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) in iOS may have killed burner wallets for iPhone users.Burner wallets are non-custodial wallets that store a user's private key in the browser’s local storage. A change made by Apple to Safari’s Webkit engine meant to enhance user privacy may jeopardize this model.This change will cap “the expiry of client-side cookies to seven days”. This implies that burner wallets will be destroyed after that short period. Although burner wallets were never intended for long-term storage of cryptocurrency, some users choose not to follow this rule.Exception to the ruleFortunately, there is one exception to this change — adding an app to the home screen. The blog post announcing the change states:“The seven-day cap on script-writable storage is gated on ‘after seven days of Safari use without user interaction on the site’. That is the case in Safari. Web applications added to the home screen are not part of Safari and thus have their own counter of days of use. Their days of use will match actual use of the web application which resets the timer. We do not expect the first-party in such a web application to have its website data deleted.”Unfortunately, adding a burner wallet to the home screen is no easy task. Former Google software engineer David Mihal wrote a blog examining the changes, and noted:“Unfortunately, there’s no ‘easy’ way to prompt a user to add a website to their home screen, users must find the button hidden inside Safari’s ‘share’ panel. Future Burner Wallets will likely display warnings to Safari users, prompting them to add the wallet to the home screen & secure their funds.”Back in 2017 there were 720 million iPhones in use around the world, it is unknown what percentage of iPhone owners use Safari-based burner wallets."

42438, What to Expect When You’re Expecting... the Bitcoin Block Halving ,2020-04-02t21:36:00+01:00,8302,96,"Many industry experts hold varied expectations for Bitcoin’s price following the block reward halving in May, proving 2020 is anything but mundane.“On both prior occasions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high within 12 months, with the latest coming in December 2017 when the price reached about $20,000, which was followed by a massive decline,” Bill Herrmann, CEO of alternative investment banking firm, Wilshire Phoenix, told Cointelegraph in an email on March 10.Herrmann also pointed out that Bitcoin’s market has matured compared to past years, noting that information available to investors is much more widespread.“From a fundamental standpoint, it’s not like the halving only has a one day affect – it will take time to see the actual ‘real’ effects in the market,” he explained. “Additionally, more institutions are involved, particularly in the trading of CME Bitcoin futures,” he said, adding:“When all of these factors are considered – I believe that the halving will be more along the lines of a ‘sell the news event’ or possibly even followed by muted prices.”Times have changed since Bitcoin’s inceptionBitcoin has only completed two prior halving events, so historical data is limited. Bitcoin’s mainstream presence has vastly also changed since its last halving in 2016. The asset now has futures and options products trading based on its price in mainstream finance, for example.Additionally, the world currently faces intense fear and instability over the coronavirus pandemic and stock market downfall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow, fell over 30% between February and March 2020, charts showed. Bitcoin also took a tumble, falling over 60% in the same time frame.Between March 12 and 13, Bitcoin suffered its most substantial price drop in more than five years, falling over 50%. In the same week, the Dow also hosted its worst single-day performance since the crash of 1987, dropping 9.99% on March 12, CNBC reported.Since then, however, Bitcoin is thought to have decoupled its price action from traditional markets. As the Dow and S&P 500 have continued posting red days, Bitcoin has largely traded sideways.Tying the coronavirus into crypto and the halvingIn a March 8 blog post under the pseudonym TwoBitIdiot, Messari CEO and founder Ryan Selkis mentioned a number of thoughts on the coronavirus and its possible impact on the world economy.Selkis talked about the halving in light of recent events. “The halving narrative is completely dead now,” he said. “The only thing that matters with respect to the halving now is whether it breaks the mining market.”Bitcoin’s halving comes every four yearsBlock halvings, which occur roughly every four years, are a fundamental part of Bitcoin’s code. Roughly every 10 minutes, one of the network’s miners solves a new block problem, thereby winning a reward that contains a pre-set number of newly minted Bitcoin. In the early years, Bitcoin’s block reward paid out 50 BTC each time miners added a new block of transactions to the chain.In 2012, the first halving occurred, cutting the block reward down to 25 BTC. Four years later, the coin’s block reward dropped again to 12.5 BTC. The 2020 halving will once more cut the reward in half, down to 6.25 Bitcoin.Opinions have varied over time regarding Bitcoin’s price relative to block halvings, but the general consensus usually leans toward the asset’s price pumping at some point surrounding the event — as was the case with each previous halving.Twitter crypto analyst, PlanB, developed a price model which shows that each halving causes a drop in Bitcoin’s supply, thereby leading to increased prices.BTC price may not yet reflect the halving event’s impactMany crypto participants on Twitter share similar sentiments, claiming that Bitcoin’s current price is not reflective of the upcoming halving. This could mean that the event is not yet baked in to the current price.Regarding this concept, Emmanuel Goh, CEO of crypto data analytics company, Skew, pointed out that Bitcoin options traders have been expecting a market downturn.""The options market has had a negative skew — price of puts relative to calls — for some time reflecting traders pricing in upside risk around the halving period,” he told Cointelegraph on March 9. “Although that has changed today with the market sell-off,"" he added, referring to price action that took Bitcoin from $8,200 down to $7,650 on March 9.Genesis Mining, one of the world’s biggest Bitcoin cloud mining operations, also gave a perspective on the upcoming event. “Since many miners liquidate their coins immediately, there will be less coins liquidated daily,” Genesis Mining head of operations, Philip Salter, told Cointelegraph on March 11, explaining the conditions as bullish.When it arrives in May, Salter said he expects the halving to be reflected in Bitcoin’s price already, without any spike northwards following the shift.Salter added:“Maybe we will see a price increase leading up to the event though. Is that for sure? No, because there are many other factors that determine the BTC price. For example, many miners will become unprofitable after the halving and they will need to cancel their power contracts and sell their mining equipment. This could be bearish. The only way to be sure is to wait and see!”Making sense of it allThe raw data shows that Bitcoin prices have always historically spiked after halving events. However, this is merely based on a sample size of two previous events — which is circumstantial evidence at best. Given Bitcoin’s mainstream prevalence at present, matched with current global turmoil, the asset could face a lot of unexpected “firsts” in the coming months and years."
42436, Dow Jones Has a Blockchain-Based Product for Fighting Fraud and Staying Compliant ,2020-04-02t20:53:00+01:00,5129,82,"Dow Jones Risk & Compliance has teamed up with a company called EastNets to build a real-time blockchain-based watchlist feed. This watchlist identifies high-risk third parties for business deals and helps maintain a business’s regulatory compliance. This blockchain-based product currently lets users solve problems associated with manually updating these watchlists and protecting data from cyber criminals.Deya Innab, chief strategy and product officer for EastNets, said:“Designing and testing a suitable solution was challenging, but we are delighted to lead the industry with a real-time, secure watchlist update solution that is actively used by leading institutions that now meet their compliance obligations every minute of the day.”Although the announcement did not reveal which institutions already use this blockchain-based watchlist, Dow Jones’s risk management and compliance arm has already gained traction among major companies like Deutsche Bank, Barron’s, and The Wall Street Journal.Blockchain adoption is growingMore and more traditional businesses are deriving value from blockchain technology. For instance, digital payment giant, PayPal, is hiring an Anti-Money-Laundering and Blockchain Strategy director for their Global Financial Crimes division. The person in this role will evaluate blockchain’s usefulness in the prevention of financial crimes.The European Commission is offering grants to blockchain developers and other specialists for solutions that adapt technologies from civil to defense applications. The use of blockchain can purportedly allow for the use of tamper-proof cryptographic tags that validate the provenance, state, and ownership of products or objects."
42435, Beware! Scammers Are Out for Crypto Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic ,2020-04-02t20:51:22+01:00,2202,112,"As the world continues to battle with the deadly coronavirus pandemic, immoral cybercriminals are once again on the prowl. This time, they are using the chaos and fear through phishing techniques and sophisticated malware hacks to access people’s crypto holdings.On March 27, residents in the United Kingdom received warnings from their local councils “to be on their guard against a series of scams attempting to take advantage of the coronavirus outbreak.” Scammers have been using other tricks to lure victims, including the use of false Bitcoin (BTC) donation channels, fake maps of the coronavirus’s spread that steal private data from computers and that install ransomware programs that can only be unlocked with Bitcoin.Fortunately, regulators such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and various American states, in addition to local councils in the U.K., as well as the European Central Bank, have all issued warnings of investment scams. False claims for BitcoinSome of the common schemes include scammers claiming to possess lists of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in a given area that they will sell to local residents in exchange for Bitcoin. According to research, this is done via phishing emails and texts that falsely claim to be from organizations such as the World Health Organization.With email subjects such as “HIGH-RISK: NEW confirmed cases in your city,” the scammers trick unsuspecting users into opening the emails. The hackers then use malicious links in the email that, when clicked, steal users’ private data.Scammers claiming to sell protective gearAs shoppers have been stocking up on essentials to prepare for a long quarantine, scammers have been busy for months on e-commerce sites like Amazon, selling counterfeit hand sanitizer and face masks. They charge high prices for items in demand, accept crypto payments and then never deliver the items to the customers. The scammers have achieved this by luring customers away from trusted sites in order to take payments addressed to phony shipping labels. Finally, the scammers then liquidate the crypto funds using several different exchanges.Hospitals have not been spared amid these widespread cyberattacks. Reports show that ransomware attacks have been prevalent in hospitals, as they are seen as soft targets. Due to the vital nature of hospital work, victims of cyberattacks who have critical IT systems encrypted by hackers are more willing to pay up whenever such criminals demand Bitcoin to regain access to needed equipment.Cybersecurity experts have started forming groups such as the COVID-19 CTI League in order to combat ransomware attacks on hospital IT systems during the current coronavirus crisis.RansomwareA team of cybersecurity experts called Malware Hunters working together with Kaspersky security analysts have uncovered a new ransomware threat called CoronaVirus. The malware was discovered on a malicious website that claimed to provide downloads of WiseCleaner, a system-optimizing application.Upon downloading the application, a malicious file activates the CoronaVirus ransomware, thereby encrypting the user’s computer. The hackers would then demand payment in Bitcoin to give back the user’s access to the computer. Other scamsOther fraudulent tricks used by scammers include the use of coronavirus maps that infect users’ computers with malware. They inject code onto computers that gleans passwords and credit card numbers, as well as other important information stored in web browsers. Other fraudsters have used articles that prompt users to subscribe to daily newsletters covering the pandemic only to expose their data to cybercriminals. To further take advantage of the global economic downturn, some have created investment and trading schemes that claim to give people an advantage in the market. Why are scammers using crypto?While commenting on why hackers and cybercriminals are increasingly facilitating their attacks using crypto, Alex Wilson, a co-founder of The Giving Block — an organization that equips nonprofit organizations to accept crypto donations — told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is not the only way to extort money, adding:“The more adoption Bitcoin gets, the more often bad people will also use it as more normal people begin to use it (proportionally). Criminals come to where honest people have their money, not vice versa. In general, illicit activity is much more prevalent in the traditional markets than in the crypto industry by a 10:1 ratio.”Andrew Adcock, the CEO of crowdfunding platform Crowd for Angels, told Cointelegraph that the reason for the increased use of crypto in cyberattacks is because “the mechanics of Bitcoin ensure that no third party can trigger a ‘refund’ of a transaction.” This means that if a customer sends crypto to a hacker, they most likely won’t get it back.Tips to avoid scamsIn order to avoid falling victim to these scams, Wilson suggests users follow due diligence before submitting funds for any donation. He also warns that most professional nonprofit organizations looking for donations will never ask for a donation directly. Therefore, users should look out for wallet addresses posted on social media as a red flag. He also added:“Only donate to registered charities to make sure your money is really being used the way you think it is. You can use sites like Guidestar.org or CharityNavigator.org to look up ratings of charities.”Adcock also recommends users take several precautionary steps to avoid scams. Users should ask themselves a couple of questions before proceeding: Is the origin of the message unknown, and has the email come from a generic address and not from a company? If unsure where the link will lead, do not click on it. Hovering over the link should show the destination. Adcock concluded: “Remember that age-old saying: ‘If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.’”Few scams have worked outThe good news is that despite the rise in the number of coronavirus- and crypto-related scams, a number of governing bodies around the world have moved quickly to issue warnings against them. For businesses, however, Adcock advises that:“There is a fine balance that needs to be found so that genuine companies are not penalized whilst spammers are combated.”"

According to the data from Bitwise Asset Management, the verifiable 24-hour spot volume of Bitcoin is estimated to be around $1.5 billion.In contrast, BitMEX alone has processed $2.9 billion in the last 24 hours, with Binance Futures, OKEx, Huobi, Bybit and Deribit also seeing high volumes across top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.On futures exchanges, traders typically use leverage ranging from 1x to 125x, essentially trading with borrowed funds. Leveraged trades leave the market vulnerable to extreme price swings, as they lead long contracts and short contracts to be liquidated in short periods of time.Prior to the drop, the majority of traders in the crypto market were longing Bitcoin.

42427, How the Pressures of the Coronavirus May Open the Door for Tokenization ,2020-04-02t19:11:00+01:00,2322,117,"The coronavirus pandemic is the only thing on most people’s minds right now around the world.The pending economic fallout is only surpassed by the anxiety induced by surging cases in both the United States and Europe. People remain firmly in quarantine around the world, and consumer demand has fallen off a cliff as people are holed up with only basic necessities.Paired with the awful Purchasing Managers’ Index numbers published by the National Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, as well as early U.S. indicators, we’re about to experience a double-pronged, concurrent supply and demand shock. The Federal Reserve has thrown the kitchen sink at the problem, and when paired with the pending fiscal relief, is set to reach $6 trillion in total relief injections into the U.S. economy.But the fiscal stimulus package and $4.25 trillion Fed lending facility, which is only capitalized by $425 billion, is largely at the discretion of the Fed when it comes to allocating relief funds and zero-interest loans. We already know how that story goes. All you need is a brief primer on a similar Troubled Asset Relief Program package in 2009.Once again, it appears that small businesses — which cannot participate in the $4.2 trillion party — are neglected to the side of the road. Small businesses are only allocated $300 billion in their own program, a clear signal of what’s about to happen to the lifeblood of American business.Only $300 billion is allocated to support a sector of the private industry accounting for 44% of U.S. economic activity. Is more debt really the solution for restaurants, mom and pop retailers, and other small businesses as they watch their cash flows annihilated under quarantine and social distancing? Probably not.Enter tokenization.Tokenization in dire straitsTokenized assets have undergone several hype cycles since the meteoric rise of the initial coin offering in 2017. First utility tokens, then security tokens and now nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. Most financial institutions tinkered with the concept of security tokens, and some have even completed audits of tokenized real estate investment trusts. However, the problems with tokenized assets have proved more difficult than anticipated.Related: Differences Between Tokens, Coins and Virtual Currencies, ExplainedThe DeFi ecosystem’s surge has spotlighted their potential once again, but the recent MakerDAO disaster did not provide any assurances for financial institutions observing from the sidelines. They have their own problems to deal with now, anyways.However, tokenization may have found its calling card: the dire need of small businesses for capital following the COVID-19 fallout.Look, there are no easy answers at this point. Many American small businesses are likely to go under in the coming months. JPMorgan Chase is projecting a minus 14% gross domestic product for the second quarter, and it appears the unlimited Fed money tap is geared towards major businesses that the government deems above the rest at the discretion of Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury Department.Brick-and-mortar stores that are suffering the most right now are only offered more debt as a solution to weeks, maybe months, of lost revenue. Many are already likely in debt. And while many small businesses are likely unaware of the potential of tokenization, for them it may be a release valve if they can’t take on more debt.Time to recapitalize.Tokenization and the friendly consumerTo understand the positive implications of tokenization for brick-and-mortar stores struggling to stay afloat right now, it’s best to use a small, local neighborhood restaurant as an example.Let’s call it The Diner.The Diner has had no customers for weeks due to quarantine and people’s social distancing. With a financial runway of only one month, the restaurant is in dire straits. Usually, the place is bustling with locals who are loyal customers and friends of the owners. Now, the place is empty.Accessing the small business loan options from the government could take weeks or months, the $1,200 checks from the fiscal stimulus package won’t save them, and more debt is onerous anyways. But The Diner has hope: tokenizing its equity and debt, or creating digital token representations of future meals at the restaurant at discounted rates.For example, the owners of The Diner could issue tokens as equity in the business to capitalize on their financial needs. Or they could issue digital tokens representing bonds in the business, just like how mid-level or large corporations perform debt financing, with the exception that the issuance occurs on Ethereum using an NFT-token representation of the contract.I know there are legal ramifications, red tape and hurdles here, but the conceptualizing of access to financial capital is an important first step. The government is unlikely to level punitive or injurious legal penalties against struggling small businesses that adapt with nuanced solutions to the crisis at this point, either. Talk about bad PR amid eroding trust in government.Local customers of The Diner could subsequently purchase the NFTs of equity or bonds as a financially prudent move or to be more altruistic and help support the local business if they have sufficient capital and aren’t expecting outsized returns. Using a blockchain wallet, The Diner could even extract the best out of the governance, transferability and flexibility of NFTs using TokenScript.One of the simpler solutions for The Diner could be just issuing ERC-20 tokens that represent fixed gift card amounts for use once the restaurant reopens again. These would basically look like discounted vouchers, as customers would be purchasing them out of loyalty to The Diner and the anticipation of a reduced price on several of their next meals there. The Diner, relying on the local community’s support, could even just launch an ICO and crowdfund money to save the business without the high fees of a distributed ledger technology platform.Legacy financial proponents would argue, “Why the need for tokenization at all?”Well, without diving into how the conventional financial system has high barriers to access, the relief package is largely ignoring small businesses, and the fragility of the financial system — especially over-leveraged corporations — caused the current dilemma in the first place. The advantage lies in the simplicity and rapid rollout on Ethereum.The Diner could roll out tokens within a few hours on Ethereum, notify the local neighborhood about how to participate and have a somewhat liquid market for The Diner NFTs within the day — some maybe even trading in secondary markets. Not an ideal way to enter the tokenization world, but not a bad solution either.When the Fed and government’s stimulus package once again ignores the needs of small businesses and instead bails out Wall Street and major corporations, small businesses may have no other option.The only choices for The Diner are to go under, take on more debt via an assuredly slow government lending facility, or resort to tokenization and enter the digital arena of next-generation finance. There are no easy answers to the current crisis and only a few solutions.At least tokenization may provide a small amount of hope for businesses like The Diner.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Victor Zhang is the CEO and co-founder of AlphaWallet.

Bitcoin dominance remains at 66%.Cryptocurrency market 24-hour view. Source: Coin3601-month Bitcoin price chartBTCUSD 1-month chart. Source: TradingviewBitcoin closed the month of March with a bearish candle close below the previous support at the 20-month moving average, which represented the first close below $6,500 in 11 months. Volume during March saw Bitcoin print the second-highest monthly volume candle of all time at Coinbase, with only December 2017 taking the prize for the highest volume.Overall volume has printed increasing selling climatic pressure over the last 18 months, but there has been a large rejection seen above the VPVR point of control that shows the price at which most volume has been traded (yellow horizontal line).The next highest volume node is where the bulls and bears are now battling it out. In the past, Bitcoin has never spent a long period of time between the price of $4,000 and $6,500. So despite the bearish close, the total rejection of trading below $4,000 is encouraging for the bulls who neutralized the memorable deleveraging event very quickly.The Relative Strength Index is trending at 49, which is neutral and fairly representative of where the price currently is.1-week Bitcoin chartBTCUSD 1-week chart. Source: TradingviewThe weekly Bitcoin chart shows that the price currently trading up against previous support, now turned resistance at around $6,800. There is also a diagonal resistance that forms the top of a channel from which Bitcoin broke out earlier this year but ultimately dates back to July 2019.The 200-week moving average defines support with very little price action occurring below it for any amount of time, indicating demand and lack of supply. The 20-week and 100-week averages are likely to be a formidable resistance point for Bitcoin as they have historically been very important support and resistance areas that dictate the bullish or bearish nature of the market.The year to date Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), which is the average price for the year, weighted for volume lies at $7,100 (as is the 100 WMA). This implies that there will be an inflection point which normally acts as a magnet for the price where most business has taken place.Overall the 200 (at $ 5,588) and 100 (at $ 7,095) week moving averages are dictating local support and resistance, the latter of which is currently under assault by the bulls.Bullish buying volume has persisted for the last three weeks but is diminishing as the price is rising. This is generally considered to be leaning bearish in an uptrend where the bulls are losing momentum, although it should be noted that the recent volume has been unusually high.The Chaikin Money Flow oscillator, which looks at the amount of Money Flow Volume over the last 20 weeks, shows that there is a bullish divergence within the volume, which is indicative of relative buying pressure.4-hour chartBTCUSD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour Bitcoin price chart shows a series of higher lows for BTC/USD and helps to illustrate the demand at the 200-week moving average and below, both of which are being front-run. There is also a failed head and shoulders top, which was another indication that the bulls are in control of the narrowing price range.The CMF has turned positive, which is a good short term signal for the bulls. But it is overall relatively neutral, which is indicative of the volume decline. The Stoch RSI is indicating that Bitcoin is overbought on lower time frames.CME & futures dataCME Futures 1-week chart. Source: TradingviewThe CME produces a Commitment of Traders report issued on Friday, which aggregates net trading positions of differently sized traders to identify the overall directional position of each category.The large-sized traders or institutional traders are illustrated by the red line on the chart above and it’s easy to see that they are nearly always short Bitcoin, but doubled down on their short positions in 2020 between $8,200 and $10,700. The chart shows that they only closed these out in the latter fall from $8,000 to $4,000.The reason this is important is that we know that a lot of the CME buying pressure was from the closure of the large-sized short positions. The retail and professional traders contributed to the selloff as should be expected, while the institutions profited by closing short positions into the supply generated from the decline.We can, therefore, assume that institutions will be interested in shorting the same range as previously, from $8,200 upwards. This is also in confluence with the weekly moving averages that are likely to cause resistance and also the yearly pivot that lies at this price.As such, the CME data may be useful to monitor the behavior of large-sized traders if Bitcoin can reach out for $8,000.Also shown on the chart is the Bitmex funding rate, which has historically had an inverse relationship with price direction when either particularly high or negative. This is showing that it has now flipped marginally positive again, which indicates a bullish shift in the market. In other words, sentiment had turned (at resistance!), which may be an opportunity for the bears.Looking forwardBitcoin is critically showing a clear lack of selling interest below the 200-week moving average and buyers appear to be stepping in at these levels, which is clearly bullish.Any break to the upside is likely to be ultimately resisted around the $8K level due to the confluence of technical resistance and known institutional short-selling interest.The first real sign of bullishness would be to start to reclaim each of the weekly moving averages and start turning them into support, with the $7,100 level at the 100-week moving average being the first objective. Should there be another downturn, the 200-week moving average will be the first line of defense.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

From an initial deposit of just $250, the scammer claims that investors can earn 300% per day or 9,000% per month.Bitcoin Revolution brokers face 21 years in prisonThe SEC warns that those who act as salesmen, brokers, dealers or agents of Bitcoin Revolution, including through online solicitation and recruitment, will face up to 21 years imprisonment and or up to $100,000 in fines alongside SEC sanctions.The regulator asserts that Bitcoin Revolution is offering unregistered securities in the form of investment contracts to the public in blatant violation of Philippine securities laws. The scheme is not registered as a company with the SEC and does not have licensing from the Philippine central bank to operate with digital assets.Ponzis use fake celebrity endorsements to advertise on social mediaLike many ponzi schemes, Bitcoin Revolution is promoted on social media using fake celebrity endorsements and news stories.At the start of March, a former employee blew the whistle on a Ukrainian Bitcoin investment scam with 200 employees. The scheme was operated by a firm called Milton Group, which occupied two floors of an office building in Kyiv. Once a victim had invested in the scheme, they would face an onslaught of phone calls pressuring them to make further deposits into the scam.The whistleblower claimed that the scheme netted $70 million in 2019, scamming investors in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The company promoted themselves through fraudulent news stories on Facebook, which detailed how local celebrities had earned a fortune through crypto trading."

Even when the cryptocurrency banking ban was in place, the Indian crypto community was actively trading and investing. It is good that they are heavily calling on regulation, with the barriers lifted, the momentum has multiplied manifold with million-dollar investments and support.”Youseff also explained that the growing mobile technology revolution in India has caused an older segment of the population to know and learn about the cryptocurrency market.Future is bright for the Indian marketThe report ensures that the future of cryptocurrencies in India looks “bright,” as 43.50% of respondents look forward to an increase in jobs and the ability to take on entrepreneurial endeavors thanks to the crypto market. Youssef commented on the growing trend shown by the survey:“The lift of the ban on cryptocurrency barriers is just the beginning of their crypto journey. India’s monthly and weekly crypto volumes are rising up every week. In just the last few days we have heard of million-dollar funds dedicated to blockchain and cryptocurrency in India.

42411, Crypto Fundraising to Aid Canary Wharf and Isle of Dogs ,2020-04-02t15:16:00+01:00,2173,114,"Bank Account Based Blockchain (BABB) and CryptoAM.io have launched a fundraising initiative on March 31 to help vulnerable and elderly people living in Canary Wharf, Poplar and the Isle of Dogs in London, United Kingdom.According to the announcement, BABB’s native cryptocurrency utility token, BAX, is the parent of the project, where transactions will be made quickly, regardless of whether they are low amounts, in addition to being an expedited and free way for the donor.Many vulnerable people reside in the Isle of DogsCryptoAM’s Crypto Insider, James Bowater, realized that many older adults are outside the country’s health and care system, which is why they are going hungry.Bowater added the following comments in this regard, also referring to recent global events:“One of the most important potential byproducts of the COVID-19 crisis will be the rebuilding of community spirit which has long been fading. By sharing [these stories] I hope that others can rediscover their community spirit.”BABB is working closely with Bowater to ensure that the raised crypto funds reach those who need it most directly, after converting it into fiat currency so they can benefit even more.Blockchain as a solution for fundraising projectsSpeaking with Cointelegraph, David Taylor, BABB’s Chief Marketing Officer, stated the following about the company’s support for this type of fundraising projects:“Canary Wharf is a global epicentre of financial services. We recently found out that many vulnerable people in the local community have fallen through the care system and need their local community to rally round – like communities used to. As a platform, BABB is able to provide global support to even the most local and humble of community projects.”Bowater said that the primary motivation for choosing a blockchain-based platform like BABB was that this technology could efficiently process the funds collected.The BABB team clarifies that donations can be made directly from credit or debit cards without incurring fees. Additionally, users can donate to other charitable causes as well.Taylor further commented to Cointelegraph on the key role that blockchain is playing on fundraising initiatives supported by BABB:“By bypassing legacy banking networks and utilising a hybrid of blockchain and databases, we’re able to cut overheads, FX exposure, processing fees and other operational costs significantly – getting more funds to where they’re needed most.”As of press time, the initiative has raised more than GBP 2,700, representing a percentage of 41.1% funded, who expect to collect close to 72,500,000 BAX, valued at GBP 5,538."
42365, Bitcoin in the Aftermath of COVID-19: Two Possible Scenarios ,2020-04-02t17:00:00+01:00,23672,71,"Futurist and author, Daniel Jeffries, shared with Cointelegraph his view on the future scenarios awaiting Bitcoin in the aftermath of COVID-19.Two possible outcomesIn one particularly dark scenario, the global economy will plunge into a severe recession and countries will turn to authoritarianism in order to survive.In such a scenario, world governments will impose capital control measures, curbing citizens’ financial freedoms. Authorities will then crack down on cryptocurrency to prevent people from circumventing their restrictions. Jeffries does not believe that Bitcoin would be able to survive in such a scenario. He stated:“Governments will swiftly move to destroy all centralized exchanges and local Bitcoin operations. Then how much is your crypto worth? It's worth nothing.”In fact, according to Jeffries, Bitcoin is still “an early alpha technology”.In an alternative scenario, a COVID-19-induced global crisis could also accelerate innovation, pressuring crypto to evolve into a complete ecosystem which offers goods and services on a large scale, and “not just money”.Jeffries invited the crypto community “to think more comprehensively”.“You have to think about it at a macro scale. You have to think about buyers and sellers. You have to think about the average user.” He said, continuing that, “You would need to think about alternative distribution mechanisms and scale. It’s not enough to solve just one of these problems. You have to solve all of them in order to build a robust community”.Bitcoin beyond the safe haven narrativeTo Jeffries, the narrative of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset was disproved in the latest market crash. Still, Bitcoin can be valuable as a proof-of-concept for other crypto technologies. He noted that the value of Bitcoin resides in:“The idea that you could build a decentralized consensus system without a centralized power behind it and that you could make that system work over a significant period of time.”The world is well prepared for COVID-19Jeffries’ forecast is overall optimistic. He pointed out that the world is better prepared than ever to face a global pandemic. In particular, communication technologies allow us to spread vital information for fighting COVID-19 at a speed that was unthinkable in the past. The global supply chain also provides many countries with the materials and goods that they need to face such crises.“Our interconnectedness, while it certainly spreads the virus quickly and accelerates it, it also accelerates the response in our ability to coordinate information at a global scale in a way that has never happened in the past.”Check out the full interview on ourYouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe!"
42409, Remaining Anonymous: Which Crypto Privacy Solution Works Best? ,2020-04-02t14:38:00+01:00,3040,89,"The cryptocurrency industry was initially headlined as anonymous digital cash. While experts were keen to point out that this was not exactly the case, Bitcoin (BTC) found initial popularity in darknet markets such as Silk Road, where merchants sold illegal goods ranging from light drugs to, allegedly, hitman services. Founded in 2011, Silk Road thrived for the next two years until the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut it down in 2013. Authorities later revealed that completely free blockchain explorers aided their investigative efforts.Bitcoin’s transaction ledger is completely open for the public to view. What the blockchain does lack is openly available identity data, as all transactions are conducted between wallet addresses, which can be considered pseudonyms. However, each wallet address is unique and can be tied to specific people or entities.Mapping an address to its holder can be as simple as making a transaction. A buyer and seller can potentially reveal their entire transaction history to each other. Though they may not know with whom they’ve transacted previously, they can know the balance and spending amounts through a simple check on a blockchain explorer. In technical terms, this is called linkability: how easy it is to reconstruct a particular chain of transactions.Bitcoin’s chain of transactions is theoretically easy to link. In practice though, this is not a trivial task, as it can be complicated to determine which part of a Bitcoin transaction is the change and which is the actual money that was spent.Bitcoin-based privacy solutionsGiven the explicit privacy weakness of Bitcoin and other open ledgers, various remedy solutions have been developed over the years. The first was proposed in early 2013 by Gregory Maxwell, a core Bitcoin developer. Later dubbed CoinJoin, the technology utilized an already existing principle of Bitcoin that single transactions can contain many “outputs” and “inputs” that flow to and from multiple wallets.Each transaction takes a certain amount of Bitcoin in the form of inputs and reshapes it, like clay, into different chunks of outputs. With CoinJoin, multiple participants offer their Bitcoin into a single transaction, which then reshapes them into different outputs that are sent to the wallets specified by each user.The result is that the chain of transactions is scrambled: an external viewer tracking wallet A doesn’t know to which exact wallet B the Bitcoin was sent to. Wallet B may contain Bitcoin pieced together from dozens of input wallets. The amount of participants, called the anonymity set, is important for the overall strength of mixing. It’s much more difficult to track one wallet out of 10,000 than one out of 10.Related: Cryptocurrency Mixers and Why Governments May Want to Shut Them DownAnother solution was given by Bitcoin mixers. Though they utilized a similar approach, they were centralized services that held custody of the Bitcoin during the scrambling process. Nevertheless, mixers initially proved popular for users as they were much simpler to implement than the peer-to-peer CoinJoin.Their security flaws were soon made evident by researchers. A December 2017 paper by Felix Maduakor demonstrated a fairly simple heuristic process to deanonymize mixer transactions. The algorithm relied on factors such as timing, Bitcoin transaction amounts and their corresponding fees to filter the destination wallet. In addition, one service had a simple web-based vulnerability that could leak all mixed transaction data by exploiting internal record keeping. A different 2017 paper also concluded that even the most popular mixers utilized poor security practices that made it easy to trace their operations.Despite the significant security flaws, mixers continued to be popular well into 2018. However, police seizures and voluntary closures pressured the sector and may have finally helped to curb their use. As Chainalysis noted in a July 2019 webinar, CoinJoin-based wallets offered by Wasabi and Samourai steadily gained popularity during 2019, processing over $250 million in Bitcoin.As a largely decentralized process, CoinJoin doesn’t rely on the security skills of mixer operators, thus removing unnecessary failure points. Despite this, the system is far from perfect. Maxwell later distanced himself from pure CoinJoin implementations, noting in a presentation that “if all the users are putting in and taking out different amounts, you can easily unravel the CoinJoin.”Though that can be mitigated by utilizing fixed output amounts, similar to cash bills, it doesn’t appear to be enough to prevent tracking. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Chainalysis CEO Michael Gronager explained:“CoinJoins and mixers do achieve a certain level of dissociation between funds. However, in many cases this link can be reestablished through forensics work.”Further evidence of the vulnerability of CoinJoin was given by Chainalysis’s investigation into the operations of PlusToken. According to a December 2019 report excerpt, the firm was able to track 45,000 Bitcoin out of the 180,000 total collected by the Ponzi scheme, despite complex obfuscation tactics that also included CoinJoin services. Nopara73, a pseudonymous developer behind Wasabi wallet, defended the technology in an “Ask Me Anything” thread on Reddit, saying, “I don't think the technical part of the story is hard to figure out. Hint: they had more coins than the entire market cap of Monero.”Privacy-based altcoins risingAs the ecosystem matured, dozens of projects arose specifically to provide private transactions to users. The present landscape is divided into several major families of coins based on different protocols.Monero (XMR) is currently the largest privacy coin by market capitalization, and it was one of the first to be introduced on the market. It’s based on the CryptoNote protocol pioneered by Bytecoin (BCN) in 2014 and augmented over time by RingCT, a system combining ring signatures and Confidential Transactions cryptography.Monero makes an effort to hide all parts of a transaction: sender, receiver and amount.The sender is hidden via ring signatures. When creating a transaction, Monero aggregates the sender’s true output with other semi-random outputs picked from previous blocks. This creates an effect similar to CoinJoin by giving plausible deniability to the user, as external parties cannot pick the real coins without additional information.A technology called Confidential Transactions further improves on this by hiding the amount of coins for each output. Stealth addresses, a part of the original CryptoNote protocol, hide the receiver by creating a one-time wallet address for each transaction.Monero’s closest competitor is Zcash (ZEC), which uses zero-knowledge cryptography to hide transactions. At a high level, zero-knowledge proofs allow for a “prover” — a user sending the money — to conclusively demonstrate to a “verifier” — or a blockchain node — that they know a certain value, without ever revealing the actual number. Used in a privacy-centric blockchain, this allows the details of a transaction to be completely encrypted and uses zero-knowledge proofs as a guarantee that it is valid. Many variants of zero-knowledge proofs exist. The one currently used by Zcash is called zk-SNARKs.The latest major addition to privacy coins is the Mimblewimble protocol. Implemented in projects such as Grin and Beam, Mimblewimble primarily uses CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions to ensure privacy. However, its blockchain architecture is significantly different from most other coins.For example, Mimblewimble blockchains do not have permanent addresses. Instead, crypto is exchanged in a two-step process: the sender delivers partially filled transaction information through external means, such as emails, and the receiver must then add their own data before retransmitting the completed transaction file.Several other projects use CoinJoin variants for their privacy features. Dash’s PrivateSend mixes coins through multiple steps of CoinJoin, while Decred’s (DCR) privacy mode uses CoinShuffle++, an updated and improved implementation of the original protocol. Though there are bitter debates between the opposing camps, each protocol comes with their own advantages and disadvantages.The price of anonymityPrivacy protocols in general suffer from performance and scalability issues. The additional layer of secrecy often has a very measurable cost in terms of transaction size, speed of execution and computing performance.Monero’s transactions are several times heavier than their equivalent on the Bitcoin network. Though the introduction of “bulletproofs” range proofs was a significant remedy to this problem, Monero transactions tend to be heavier than 1,500 bytes, while simple Bitcoin transactions can be as low as 280 bytes.This poses a significant problem for scalability. Though Monero has dynamic block sizes, avoiding true bottlenecks, the entire blockchain still grows significantly faster in size. Eventually, it will become impossible to maintain Monero nodes on simple computers, which its community sees as a major aspect of decentralization.Zcash is a mixed blockchain containing both transparent and “shielded” transactions. Private transactions suffer from a similar size problem to Monero, weighing on average 2,000 bytes.Before the introduction of Sapling, sending money privately also required about 4 GB of available RAM, which made shielded transactions highly impractical.Similar problems exist for Mimblewimble-based coins. Its raw transactions are over 5,000 bytes due to the presence of heavy-range proofs. The primary scalability benefit for Mimblewimble-based coins is the ability to “prune” a blockchain: removing past transaction data without impacting its validity. Grin estimated a reduction of roughly 98% for a sample case of 10 million transactions, from around 130 GB to just under 2 GB. That is less than half the size of the Bitcoin blockchain when it had the same amount of transactions in December 2012, according to data from Blockchain.com.The ability to prune a blockchain is a major factor for some researchers. While Monero was considered unable to scale through pruning, the team released a limited implementation of it at the start of 2019. Critics described it as “more like sharding than pruning” due to its failure to completely remove transactions. Monero developers explained on Twitter that removing outputs is impossible with current technology, adding, “Our implementation definitely prunes certain transaction data.”Zcash was also unable to prune its data, but the team at Electric Coin Company — the company behind Zcash — chose to further leverage zero-knowledge proofs to introduce a similar concept of scaling. Its proposed Halo technique would use a “proofs of proofs” system that would confirm the validity of the blockchain’s past states. This would allow nodes to only hold data on recent transactions, together with a proof of correctness for everything that occurred earlier.Compromises on privacyPracticality, decentralization and anonymity issues often pose a trilemma for any single privacy technology. Though Monero scores relatively well on practicality and decentralization, its anonymity has been put into question in the past.Fireice_uk, a pseudonymous Monero contributor and the developer of the xmr-stak miner software, identified several weaknesses in the ring signature approach, noting that churning immediately exposes the true origin of the funds by creating a loop of transactions. They also demonstrated a way to break normal ring signatures based on leakage of metadata: the transaction’s time of creation can be compared with internet service provider records to identify the true output.Leading Monero community members responded on Reddit, acknowledging some of these concerns while downplaying their relevance. When asked by Cointelegraph whether the team acted upon these concerns, fireice_uk said that the efforts have been insufficient:“Over the past year, the volume of research into metadata leaks increased and they only fixed the very lowest hanging fruit. The current state of affairs leaves me uncertain if the whole ring signature based family of coins is viable — and I'm saying that as a dev of one of them.”Sarang Noether, a pseudonymous member of the Monero Research Lab, responded to this criticism in a conversation with Cointelegraph. While noting that this is a “subtle issue” that depends on the implied threat model — who wants to deanonymize the transactions — they added:“There's network-level metadata floating around, which may or may not affect a particular user depending on their threat model — and is tricky to reduce. There's on-chain metadata floating around, including things like timing, input/output structure, non-standard transaction data, etc. Reducing exploitable metadata is important, but eliminating it entirely is impossible.”Addressing churning, Noether noted that it is a subject of ongoing research, while revealing that there are proper and improper ways of doing it: “Similar to how to choosing decoy inputs poorly can lead to heuristics about what is more likely to be the true signer, churning ‘badly’ could lead to heuristics trying to identify the process.”Though the cryptography powering Zcash shielded transactions is often described as fundamentally better than that of Monero’s, the dominance of transparent addresses places strong restrictions. Researchers from University College London, now officially known as UCL, were able to de-anonymize several transfers by tackling the conversion step between shielded and unshielded coins. When asked whether Zcash sees value in increasing the amount of shielded transactions and thus the anonymity set, Electric Coin Company’s vice president of marketing, Josh Swihart, told Cointelegraph:“A large anonymity set is important, and we don’t believe there is a point of diminishing returns. We share the world with billions of people, each driving dozens of transactions per month, and hundreds of millions of businesses and institutions driving many multiples more. The anonymity set should be large enough to safely protect all of those people, companies and institutions on a per-transaction basis.”Swihart also pointed out that the amount of fully shielded transactions grows over time, which increases its anonymity set. Nevertheless, data shows that the ratio of shielded to transparent transaction volume has been oscillating between 10% and 20% for most of Zcash’s history, with little recent growth:Centralization is also a major concern for Zcash, as zk-SNARKs require a “trusted setup” to properly function: specific parameters set by the developers. Any security or trust compromise during each generation event would be catastrophic, as attackers would be able to create new coins virtually undetected. Nevertheless, the introduction of Halo-based technology would remove the need for a trusted setup.Discussing the importance of anonymity sets, fireice_uk emphasized, “It is life-or-death critical. It is impossible to hide in a crowd of 1. Anything that can be done to whittle down the crowd will impact privacy.” They added, “We can see that very well with the Mimblewimble break,” referring to the breakthrough by Ivan Bogatyy — a researcher at Dragonfly Capital — who de-anonymized up to 96% of real-time Grin transactions.Grin developers responded by dismissing the importance of the breakthrough. However, they acknowledged that “Grin’s privacy is far from perfect,” noting that “transaction linkability is a limitation that we’re looking to mitigate.”Is there a clear leader?Though each system has its own strengths and weaknesses, it ultimately comes down to each user to make the best of available tools. Even Zcash, which has arguably the most resilient anti-linkability system, can still be misused through careless transitions between transparent and shielded addresses. Monero is in this sense somewhat easier to use. As Chainalysis reported in its webinar, it is the preferred privacy coin in darknet markets.Yet, Bitcoin remains the most popular payment method. Furthermore, its users tend to not place emphasis on privacy, with the majority of funds to darknet markets sent directly from centralized exchanges.Privacy-enhancing technology appears to be uninteresting to darknet market users, the segment that arguably would need it most. Until privacy coins are widely adopted in high-stakes environments like these, debates on their anonymity will remain highly theoretical.Non-criminal case for privacyIt’s important to note that privacy should not be strictly associated with illicit use. Chainalysis highlighted that only a little more than 10% of funds sent to mixers come from criminal activities.A similar proportion can be expected in privacy coin use. Though regulators are increasingly scrutinizing cryptocurrency-enabled crime, maintaining some privacy for legitimate use is critical, according to Chainalysis’s CEO:“Complete anonymity opens the door to illicit activity that by definition cannot be investigated. That's not a world you want to live in. On the other hand, complete transparency means no privacy at all. That's also not a world you want to live in. We believe that the market decides, and currently the non-privacy coins see the most momentum.”Speaking on behalf of the company, Swihart’s stance on transaction privacy understandably went even further. Electric Coin Company believes that a person’s ability to transact with others is a fundamental right, while “businesses have a right to transact securely without exposing information to competitors or others that might wish them harm.”Answering a question on whether facilitating criminal use is an acceptable compromise for privacy, Swihart added, “The compromise argument is a red herring. People with bad intent will use whatever tools they can to do illegal things. Today, that mostly involves the US dollar.”"
42407, Coinbase Invests $1 Million in DeFi Projects UniSwap and PoolTogether ,2020-04-02t13:33:00+01:00,2736,86,"Coinbase continues to ramp up its support for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, announcing a fresh $1.1 million investment via its USDC Bootstrap Fund for two projects in the field.The USDC Bootstrap Fund — launched by Coinbase and Circle as part of the Centre Consortium in early fall 2019 — aims to encourage DeFi development by investing funds denominated in stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) directly into DeFi protocols.As Coinbase revealed on April 1, the fund is investing $1 million in USDC for decentralized exchange Uniswap’s USDC/Ether (ETH) pool.It is also contributing $100,000 in USDC to the daily prize offered by PoolTogether — a lossless lottery that offers users interest on the Dai (DAI) and USDC they deposit to buy tickets and compete.The two projectsEthereum-based Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that runs without an order book, instead relying on asset pairs with ETH as a fixed base currency. As reported, the exchange has recently announced plans to release a V2 update in Q2 2020, which will allow direct token-to-token swaps.Coinbase notes that the project is emerging as one of the most liquid exchanges built on Ethereum, providing exchanges (also known as pools) for over 880 tokens. To help support the critical infrastructure and liquidity this provides for DeFi projects, the fund is injecting $1 million USDC to bolster UniSwap’s USDC/ETH pool.PoolTogether — which uses the money market protocol Compound — is, as noted, a “lossless lottery.” The project enables users to deposit either DAI or USDC in respective pools, which generate interest. For each one stablecoin deposited, users receive a lottery ticket: each week, the interest collectively earned by each pool is awarded to the holder of the winning ticket.The Fund’s contribution of $100,000 in USDC to the pool will therefore increase the lottery reward for all USDC depositors.DeFi integration and investmentIn late March, Coinbase revealed that the Coinbase Wallet would enable users to earn interest on deposited cryptocurrencies by integrating two DeFi apps — Compound, and dYdX. Both apps offer automated lending interest rates, with dYdX offering margin trading services on top of this.Prior to this integration, Coinbase had provided $1 million in USDC to both Compound and dYdX when it first announced the creation of the USDC Bootstrap Fund.As Coinbase and other industry actors have noted, there remains some concern that emerging DeFi apps and the smart contracts they deploy could contain security flaws in their interactions with users’ wallets."
42406," Binance Announces CoinMarketCap Acquisition, CZ Gives the Scoop ",2020-04-02t14:00:00+01:00,14254,475,"While global markets are experiencing tough times amid the coronavirus pandemic, the crypto industry is getting stronger as its core players have tapped one of the biggest crypto mergers in history.Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has reached an agreement to acquire CoinMarketCap, one of the most-referenced crypto data websites, in an undisclosed deal. The companies officially announced the acquisition to Cointelegraph on April 2.Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, said that Binance and CMC are very similar, as they are both providers of “access-to-crypto” and share a vision of making crypto assets more accessible and useful for people around the world. Zhao said:""The acquisition will enable us to build on each other's strengths, and further grow and instill transparency in the industry.”Zhao told Cointelegraph that the company has been in talks with CMC for a few months before closing the deal in April. While the acquisition is rumored to have cost Binance $400 million, Zhao said that the company cannot disclose the amount of the deal, as it is protected by a non-disclosure agreement.CMC will operate independentlyWhile the companies are going to work closely together, CMC will still continue to operate as an independent business entity, both Binance and CMC emphasized. Zhao stressed that the acquisition will not change CMC's independence from external stakeholders:“Binance has no bearing on CoinMarketCap rankings. CoinMarketCap stays committed to providing the most accurate, timely and quality cryptocurrency data in the industry while benefiting from Binance’s expertise, resources and scale.”However, CMC will immediately undergo some internal restructuring as part of the deal. Brandon Chez, CMC’s founder, will be stepping down as CEO and will be replaced by CoinMarketCap’s current chief strategy officer, Carylyne Chan, as interim CEO.Apart from the reshuffle, CoinMarketCap will not see any changes in its team in the near future, or at least the next couple of months. Chan told Cointelegraph:“Other than that, there won't be any other major team changes at CoinMarketCap. Everyone is going to stay on and everyone is really excited about what's happening. [...] I think that no other major changes that we see, definitely not in the next couple of months.”CoinMarketCap to remain neutral regarding project listingsAccording to Chan, Binance did its best to ensure that CMC can continue to adhere to its own listing methodology. The interim CEO told Cointelegraph that the firm is not planning any sufficient listing changes anytime soon:“We’ll stick to our listing requirements and make sure that everything is fair and unbiased to anyone who wants to list anything on CoinMarketCap. So that will be our firm commitment that [...] will not change following the acquisition.”So, what does this acquisition really mean?While CMC will continue to operate independently to ensure neutral and transparent data, Binance will be contributing significantly to CoinMarketCap’s further development and projects in 2020, Chan noted.The exchange, which has at least 800 employees worldwide, is expected to share its expertise in a number of areas like finance and security. Chan highlighted that the acquisition will help CMC evolve:“We are going to get a lot from Binance in terms of understanding how they're running a better team in terms of best practices. I think there are some really basic things around security, finance that we will learn from Binance just based on the fact that they have a way larger team than us and have scaled out much more efficiently.”The CMC acquisition comes about six months after industry reports claimed that CoinMarketCap was “entirely bootstrapped” — i.e., continuing its operations with minimal financial resources. In October 2019, Chan reportedly said that CMC did not plan to raise any funds soon and was continuing “bootstrapping and scaling.”"
42404," Gold Is ‘Toilet Paper’ for the Rich, Bitcoin for the Poor — Max Keiser ",2020-04-02t13:03:00+01:00,14862,196,"People are going to buy Bitcoin (BTC) in droves — because there will be no gold for sale due to coronavirus, Max Keiser predicts.In a recent edition of his Keiser Report news program on March 31, Keiser said that the coronavirus pandemic will push billionaires into gold as a safe haven.Keiser: people will “flock en masse” to BTCOnce supplies are bought up and stockpiled, the only alternative left is Bitcoin.He summarized:“I predict — and this is not only the ultimate use case but the ultimate irony — that once people realize that they cannot get gold, they’ll start flocking en masse into Bitcoin.”The basis for the claim was a report from Bloomberg from March 25 which warned that the gold industry was “facing unprecedented turmoil” due to a spike in demand.As Cointelegraph reported, the precious metal has seen noticeable price volatility in 2020. From lows of $1,469 just two weeks ago, markets have since shot up to highs of $1,629 — an increase of 10.9% in just one week.Bitcoin versus gold 1-year chart. Source: Skew.comCoronavirus: is gold the next toilet paper?Gold has a number of drawbacks over Bitcoin. In contrast to the cryptocurrency, it is costly and risky to move, especially across borders, and generally needs a trusted third party to store it. Unlike on the Bitcoin blockchain, there is also no way for the market to know in real-time whether a particular unit of gold is genuine.Gold is also afflicted by the phenomenon which has impacted every money in history except Bitcoin — the higher the price, the more effort humanity devotes to increasing the supply.As Saifedean Ammous notes in his book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” Bitcoin cannot have its supply increased, even if its price rises dramatically, due to its difficulty adjustment feature.On the topic of supply, the Keiser Report added that this time, unlike the financial crisis of 2008, gold mines are shutting down over coronavirus, ironically stifling the opportunity to boost the supply.“We could be encountering a severe crisis in the gold markets, just like in the toilet paper markets,” co-host Stacey Herbert summarized.Keiser had previously stated:“Remember: billionaires think of gold and silver the way the unemployed think about toilet paper.”"
42403, Ontario Conservation Authorities Test Blockchain for Green Energy on Smart Grids ,2020-04-02t13:00:00+01:00,2190,87,"Canadian conservation authorities and technology firm Insolar are conducting a test-bed blockchain project for renewable energy management.Within the scope of its Sustainable Technologies Evaluation Program (STEP), on April 1 the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) announced a collaboration with blockchain specialist Insolar to leverage the technology for managing distributed energy resources (DERs).Ontario’s long-term energy plan has reportedly identified DERs as an essential policy strategy that will help to close the growing gap in electricity supply as the region works to replace 30% of its conventional power production with sustainable sources over the next 15 years.Data flows and smart power gridsInsolar has developed a blockchain platform, Assured Ledger, which offers trusted data exchange for transactive energy systems. These are crucial for making DERs viable at scale, the company claims.Sources such as solar and wind can be used as a backup or replacement to achieve a more sustainable energy mix, provided they are coordinated on the power grid’s edge. This ostensibly ensures they do not stop utilities from providing a reliable energy supply.To securely manage the flow and exchange of energy from renewable distributed sources within existing electric power systems, blockchain can serve as a critical piece of infrastructure, as STEP technical coordinator Gil Amdurski explained:“It can connect and aggregate prosumer DERs, enterprise microgrids, and electric vehicles to the grid. Thus, the energy supply from renewables is managed optimally: it can be stored and redistributed when and where it is needed. This can stabilize grids, reduce peak demand, and make utilities future-ready without having to rebuild their infrastructure.”Amdurski further outlined that renewables-powered electric vehicles “can act as batteries and feedback into the grid,” while their owners can in turn be “incentivized to charge outside of peak load times.”A representative from Insolar Energy Projects, Lesley Czuma, added that the blockchain system needs to be highly scalable, reliable and securely automated to achieve a reduction in peak loads, prevent blackouts, support access to distributed renewable sources, and minimize costs at the consumer end.Blockchain’s advantages are essentially a question of coordination and smart data management for energy demand across complex networks, as Czuma’s statement said:“Reliable data flows and a solid communication platform are key to reaping the benefits of DERs in smart grids. This is especially true as the number of prosumers and devices that must be connected and coordinated grows.”Blockchain in the renewables sectorAs reported yesterday, Australian blockchain firm Power Ledger and French green energy retailer ekWateur are now offering almost a quarter of a million French residents the opportunity to customize their energy mix, using blockchain to securely certify its source.In January 2020, researchers at Ireland’s Economic and Social Research Institute proposed that blockchain can offer tailored mechanisms that incentivize renewable energy consumption, such as the forward selling of renewable electricity generation:“Claims on future electricity production can be directly traded between generators and consumers through blockchain [...] These claims on future generation could be embodied as nonfungible blockchain tokens with future electrical power delivery as the underlying asset.”"
42401, SEC Postpones Decision on Overstock-Affiliated Security Token Exchange ,2020-04-02t11:54:00+01:00,2377,75,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking more feedback and more time before it decides whether to approve the launch of the Boston Security Token Exchange (BSTX).In a letter published on April 1, the regulator postponed the current April 2 deadline in light of responses to a recent proposed rule change to BSTX’s original filing.The proposed exchangeBSTX is a project for a regulated security token exchange platform that would be jointly owned by Box Digital Markets and Overstock’s blockchain arm tZERO. As the SEC summarizes in its April 1 letter, the project proposes the operation of a platform using:“A fully automated, price-time priority execution system to list and trade NMS stocks that meet BSTX listing standards and for which ancillary records of ownership reflecting certain end-of-day security token balances as reported by market participants would be created and maintained using distributed ledger technology.”The SEC briefly outlined the results of the feedback it had solicited earlier this year on the BSTX application and subsequent amendments filed by Box and tZERO.The two comment letters received had raised concerns that the platform could represent a “significant change for the equities market,” as well as noting the affiliation of the tZERO token with owners of the exchange, Overstock, and other entities. The relationships between these actors warrant further disclosure and analysis, the commentator had argued.One of the letters also pointed to the 85% decrease in the token’s value since its issuance less than two years ago. Both commenters had appealed to the SEC to spend more time evaluating the proposal.In view of the legal and policy issues raised by the application, the SEC is seeking more time to study whether the proposed exchange would be consistent with sections of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These require, among other things, that the exchange is not “designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.”Contributors have three weeks to submit initial thoughts, and an additional two weeks to respond to others’ comments.Industry actors’ concernsAs previously reported, one of the commenters had drawn the Commission's attention to their concerns over Box’s apparently exclusive access to the distributed ledger that would be used to support security token trading on the platform.The feedback also alleged there was insufficient detail regarding BTSX’s digital securities infrastructure and technology pairing with the existing equities market infrastructure."
42400, FATF Report: US Is Not Focusing Enough on Crypto Financial Risk ,2020-04-02t11:41:00+01:00,2144,82,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has reevaluated the United States on its compliance with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) regulations. According to the report published on March 31, the U.S. is only “largely compliant” with FATF regulations on cryptocurrencies and virtual assets.The assessment considered the degree of compliance of the national legislation to recommendations issued by FATF, an international regulatory standard body. Recommendation 15, dealing specifically with cryptocurrencies, is among the most discussed issues in the report.Since the last assessment in 2016, the FATF rating of the U.S. on this matter has not changed. However, FATF’s own guidelines for cryptocurrencies were amended significantly in October 2019, in what is commonly known as the FATF Travel Rule.Thus the assessment reflects the change in methodology, which involves a deeper scrutiny than earlier.U.S. regulation is non-specific, but it mostly worksThe agency commended the increased awareness of the risks shown by U.S. regulators, citing the creation of several task forces and reports such as the “2018 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment.”U.S. regulations are also effective in covering the different types of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) defined by FATF, which would include entities such as exchanges and custodians. However, the report notes that they do not explicitly deal with the specific case of a VASP that is incorporated in the U.S., but has otherwise no business in the country.Cryptocurrency operators are generally considered as Money Services Businesses (MSB), a categorization that has very high standards of compliance. As such, most MSBs are required to develop effective AML and CTF policies, which FATF believes are generally sufficient.Furthermore, it notes that some businesses may also have to adhere to regulations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which further improves compliance. The report nevertheless criticizes the U.S. for maintaining its $3,000 threshold for occasional unidentified transactions. FATF guidance suggests a limit of no more than $1,000.The agency was not particularly impressed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), however. While it notes that both conducted examinations of various cryptocurrency exchanges, individual exchangers and others, it criticizes the generic strategy.According to FATF, the U.S. does not identify higher-risk service providers as they are covered by the MSB regime. Continuing, the report states:“Therefore, it is not entirely clear whether the current approach is sufficiently risk focused, especially since only 30% of all registered CVC [convertible virtual currency] providers have been inspected since 2014.”The overall conclusion appears to be that U.S. regulators have failed to single out cryptocurrency service providers when enforcing regulation, but the issues outlined are still considered minor. Enough for the U.S. to deserve what amounts to a “B” in FATF’s grading system."
42399, Insight on Liquidity from DeFi Protocols ,2020-04-02t11:14:00+01:00,1150,76,"Over the last year and a half, decentralized finance has had an explosion of activity. Lending and borrowing decentralized applications, margin trading, liquidity protocols, stablecoins, insurance and derivatives have all grown in user numbers, in on-chain activity and in product maturity. As DeFi has grown, the need to exchange value from one form to another has grown with it, and multiple liquidity providers have stepped up to service this growing need for liquidity. This is the natural evolution of any system, introducing expanding functionality and connectivity and as it grows.Based on our own experience, we wanted to share some insights into decentralized markets and how to scale up to meet DeFi’s growing demands. We feel it’s an important lesson in building a sustainable, growth-oriented future for DeFi.Related: DeFi Can Now Choose to Run Trustless Zero-Knowledge ProofsEfficient use of token inventoryThere are multiple ways to bring liquidity to the market. Some liquidity providers use an automated market-making model that uses a predetermined curve to arrive at price discovery, while more manual models include liquidity providers actively rebalancing inventory using multiple sources of liquidity from centralized exchanges and other sources.Automated market makers, or AMMs, are a great hands-off, open and permissionless approach, with Uniswap — a fully decentralized protocol for automated liquidity provision based on Ethereum — serving as one example. One notable downside to this approach is that tokens can end up being “priced to infinity” (on the extreme edges of the curve), meaning a portion of the token inventory locked up is being inefficiently allocated to price points that are not required by the market and are highly unlikely to be hit in the short term.Related: Book Review - CoinGecko’s ‘How to DeFi’Our approach to scaling goes through combining multiple different market maker types under one platform. We cater to automated market-making by providing a very capital-efficient AMM model that allows for setting specific self-stipulated price ranges, while in parallel allowing manual market makers to also plug their liquidity into the platform. This increased competition between market makers, and an improved AMM model, allows for existing inventory to be used more efficiently and we’re therefore able to facilitate more volume than other liquidity providers for the same inventory size. This approach helps scale up liquidity, especially in volatile times such as those seen during Black Thursday’s huge price drops. While some market makers backed off in the face of large price movements that day, Kyber kept providing liquidity due to redundancies that come from pulling in liquidity from multiple market makers.Exposure to the DeFi ecosystemIt’s been encouraging to see that the required liquidity coming from the demand side — i.e., DApps and their users — has congregated mostly around on-chain price discovery and execution models as opposed to hybrid and off-chain models. This is mostly due to the ease with which different financial primitives can be composed and put together completely on-chain to provide new services, even though hybrid and off-chain models can have a speed advantage during trade execution.Related: How Market Volatility Is Shining a Light on DeFi’s Structural VulnerabilitiesLiquidity in on-chain models can easily be slotted into complex DeFi workflows that include various borrowing, lending and margin trading products. On-chain transparency allows for increased ecosystemwide confidence in the technical viability of what DeFi projects are building, although this is not to say DeFi systems don’t occasionally stumble due to bugs or protocol-level constraints and risks. A lot of the volume and trade activity growth within the Ethereum ecosystem has come from fully on-chain liquidity providers like Oasis, Uniswap and Kyber.Related: When Will Bitcoin Join the DeFi Revolution?Market making ability and incentivesCorrect incentive design is crucial to bringing both liquidity providers and liquidity takers to the table, and incorrectly calibrated incentives can suppress growth due to increased cost and friction at the point of exchange. Most decentralized liquidity providers have opted for a taker-fee model where the taker side — i.e., the end-user — pays a small fee that is then split between the market maker and the protocol itself. This calibration has evolved, of course, as providers have grown in strength and diversity. Still, there’s an opportunity for leaps forward, and Kyber’s Katalyst will provide a new model of incentive design centered around Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) holders governing fee parameters.Toward the single liquidity endpoint for DeFiWe have come a long way from the early days of DeFi when liquidity levels were low and inventory siloed. Today’s DeFi landscape is a vibrant and thriving one with DeFi DApps interconnected with each other to create unique value chains and exciting new products. Decentralized finance requires decentralized liquidity, and as a result, on-chain liquidity providers have seen the strongest demand in their liquidity solutions. We expect the DeFi space to keep growing in leaps and bounds for the foreseeable future, and fueling that growth will involve more efficiencies, better connectivity and innovative incentives.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Deniz Omer is the head of ecosystem growth at Kyber Network and the founder of Cryptodyssey Capital and ICODueDiligience.com.

42398," Pandemic Is Changing Bitcoin Usage in ‘Unexpected Ways,’ Says Chainalysis ",2020-04-02t10:59:00+01:00,7090,184,"Leading blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis has found that the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic contraction is affecting Bitcoin (BTC) consumer habits in surprising ways.In a new report published on March 30, Chainalysis details how Bitcoin spending trends in three areas — merchant services, gambling and darknet marketplaces — have changed, or even reversed.Weakening correlation could be a boon for Bitcoin merchant services, says reportChainalysis reported that one such change in trend shows resilience among Bitcoin merchant services in the current economic crisis.For example, the firm’s data for Bitcoin spending using merchant services from July 2019 until March 9, 2020 reveals that there was a strong positive correlation between price and expenditure: the more Bitcoin is worth, the more likely holders are to spend it.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, this positive correlation has weakened by roughly half, and the total value of expenditure has declined.While this indicates that Bitcoin holders are indeed spending less during Bitcoin’s recent decline in value, this decrease is less dramatic than might otherwise have been expected. This is because since the outbreak, the strength of the correlation between price and behavior has itself also weakened.So while Bitcoin’s decline in price does continue to lead to reduced spending — it does not do so as significantly as it would have done in pre-pandemic times. A weakened correlation means that the price does is not dictating consumer behavior as strongly as before.Bitcoin usage, 7 July 2019— 27 March 2020. Source: Chainalysis blogDarknet marketplaces take a hitMost conspicuous of all is the change in user behavior on darknet marketplaces, which usually has only a weak negative correlation to Bitcoin’s price. Since the outbreak, however, this correlation has reversed and strengthened — leading to a significant decrease in darknet market revenue.Chainalysis points to possible external factors to explain this trend, noting that illicit substances such as recreational drugs may be harder to come by due to the impact of disrupted supply chains worldwide:“Recent reports point out that Mexican drug cartels are having a harder time sourcing fentanyl, as China’s Hubei province — a hub of the global fentanyl trade — has been hit hard as the epicenter of the outbreak. Such disruptions [...] could be hampering darknet market vendors’ ability to do business.”With gambling, its marginally positive correlation to Bitcoin price has corrected to zero since early March 2020 (i.e. no relationship), signaling that there appears to be no discernable impact of the pandemic on gamblers’ behavior.Chainalysis closes its report noting that with China’s gradual comeback from the domestic COVID-19 crisis, darknet activity now appears to be seeing a gradual recovery there.In January 2020, a Chainalysis report revealed that the volume of cryptocurrency flows on darknet markets had doubled in 2019 for the first time in four years."
42397, Top Ripple Dev Publishes Method to Increase Privacy Using ‘Blinded Tags’ ,2020-04-02t10:32:00+01:00,1953,64,"Nik Bougalis, a cryptographer, software engineer and lead of the C++ team at Ripple, has published a proposed method for enhancing the privacy of transactions on the XRP ledger.In his Github post on March 30, Bougalis focused on the destination tags that are assigned to transactions made between wallets provided by exchanges or third-party providers — also known as hosted wallets.Bougalis argued that these destination tags present a potential privacy risk for users, which could be overcome through his proposed system of “blinded tags.”Blinded TagsAny transaction made between hosted wallets on the XRP ledger involves two types of tag: a source tag, which indicates to which user has initiated the transaction, and a destination tag, which indicates to whom the transacted funds are to be sent.On a cryptocurrency exchange, the source tag (i.e. wallet address) can remain constant or variable (depending on users’ individual choice), but the exchange generates a unique destination tag for each transaction.Destination tags, in their current form, are unsigned 32-bit integers — meaning that there exists over 4 billion possible unique combinations that can be used to create each tag. At present, these 4+ billion combinations are sufficient to enable exchanges to generate a unique destination tag for each user — and perhaps for the foreseeable future, Bougalis says.Yet the issue is not the finitude of possible combinations, but rather the privacy challenges that destination tags pose, as an attacker could feasibly correlate transactions by isolating the “{ address, tag } pair as a unique address corresponding to a single customer.”One way to surmount this problem would be to use a system of so-called “blinded tags” — tags that are, in Bougalis’ outline, “mutated in such a way that it is meaningful only to the sender and the recipient of a transaction, but appears random to everyone else.”The method proposed by Bougalis is intended, he says, to be “secure, minimal, and performant”:“Ideally, it should be possible to implement tag blinding as a single function call that does not noticeably increase the time necessary to assemble a transaction. Similarly, using a blinded tag should not make it significantly harder for the intended recipient to process a transaction.”Privacy-oriented developmentsLast spring, Ripple’s Xpring joined the firm behind privacy-focused altcoin Zcash (ZEC) to invest in Bolt Labs — a crypto payments startup aiming to develop a more anonymous second-layer protocol that could be added to existing cryptocurrency networks.This March, Cointelegraph reported on the potential of using trustless privacy technology in combination with zero-knowledge proofs (Zk-SNARKs) to bolster anonymity even further."
42392, US Stimulus Package Might Cause ‘Modest’ Improvement to Bitcoin Market ,2020-04-02t09:23:00+01:00,3280,74,"The $2 trillion economic stimulus package the United States Congress passed on March 26 might not cause the Bitcoin (BTC) market to skyrocket just yet, but investors could see modest, gradual improvements starting in 2020.Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse and founder of virtual currency platform Coincurve, spoke to Cointelegraph on Wednesday regarding the outlook of Bitcoin following measures to help the U.S. economy recover.Stimulus package targeted at those without disposable incomeEven in the midst of a global pandemic, many crypto traders are expecting Bitcoin to reach all-time highs before 2021. Online searches for cryptocurrencies have increased as investors may be shying away from traditional markets while stuck at home, but this does not necessarily mean crypto newbies and veterans will be using their $1,200 checks to purchase Bitcoin.Part of the reason for the stimulus package is to help those who have lost their sole source of income or had it substantially reduced in the midst of measures to fight COVID-19, including being unable to come to work.Chen argues that this targets a segment of the population who would want to save “to prepare for the worst.” Investing in Bitcoin may be on the backburner:“I think people will generally still be holding crypto even after the stimulus package… I don’t think an extra [thousand dollars] of extra pay into their bank account is going to trigger a huge buy activity in the whole cryptocurrency market.”Why aren’t more investors flocking to Bitcoin?Though the stimulus package will provide income to all segments of the U.S. population, the reactions might end up being the same as the economy potentially moves into a recession i.e. people will save, not buy. This applies to both cryptocurrencies and traditional markets, which have taken huge hits in March.While Chen is optimistic about the economy as a whole, he believes the impact on Bitcoin will be minor, rather than the predictions of some anticipating highs over $27,000:“...it will be very modest. It’s going to be very gradual. It’s not a lot of money that people [are getting]. People are going to be saving for the longer term… I don’t think it’s going to send Bitcoin to an all-time high.”Chen's firm Coincurve recently announced the acquisition of BuyBitcoinCanada.com, to become Canada’s leading virtual currency platform."

42389, Decoupling? Bitcoin Price Surges Above $6.7K as Stocks Again Bearish ,2020-04-02t06:54:00+01:00,7303,86,"Since topping out at $6,500 on March 31, Bitcoin (BTC) price had spent the majority of Wednesday in a steady slump which saw the price drop from $6,494 to $6,147. The pullback mirrored the poor performance in traditional markets where the S&P 500 and Dow dropped by 4.41% and 4.44% respectively.The slump in traditional markets appeared to be a reaction to dismal news that the United States surpassed more than 200,000 Coronavirus cases. Earlier this week the White House also stated that it concurs with the estimate that up to 240,000 Americans could die from COVID-19 within the next 3 weeks.If true, this would likely extend the time social distancing and mass quarantine policies stay in effect, leading to additional damage to the economy. As advised by many market analysts, global markets are unlikely to show signs of bottoming until the Coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.Crypto market daily price chart. Source: Coin360Surprisingly, shortly after equities markets closed Bitcoin price broke from the pattern of lower highs with a sharp upside move which pushed the price to $6,744.The move came as the price was on the verge of falling below the $6,200 support to complete the right shoulder of a rather sloppy head and shoulders pattern on the 4-hour time frame.Had that occurred, traders would be looking at a target near $5,150 so for bulls the current surge above the $6,600 resistance level is probably a welcome relief.BTC USDT 4-hour chart.

Source: TradingViewOn the daily timeframe, the volume profile visible range shows that above $6,900, the $7,100 to $7,200 zone could present stiff resistance. For the short term, holding $6,600 as support then setting a higher high above $6,900 would be a positive step forward.Alternatively, if the Bitcoin price loses momentum, a pullback to retest underlying support at $6,400 (Bollinger Band moving average) and $6,300 is likely. If the event of a stronger correction, Bitcoin price has support at $6,200, $5,850 and $5,350.Over the coming hours, traders should keep an eye on the shorter time frame buy and sell volume to see if the price will either hold $6,600 or pullback from the upper Bollinger Band arm to retest $6,400 where the Bollinger Band moving average is.If the price drops below the 20-MA of the indicator then a retest of the $6,200 support which is slightly above the lower Bollinger Band arm.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42388, ‘Breakthrough’ as Lightning Uses Web's Forgotten Payment Code ,2020-04-02t06:50:00+01:00,2495,83,"Lightning Labs has published its draft specification for Lightning Service Authentication Tokens (LSAT) — a protocol standard that promises to redefine online payments through employing a little known HTTP status code.According to a March 30 blog post authored by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun, LSAT facilitates automated logins and payments using cryptographic credentials — doing away with the current system of credit cards, usernames, and passwords.LSAT leverages 402 error codeOsuntokun states that the LSAT protocol leverages the “widely underused” HTTP 402 ‘payment required’ status code.The 402 error is returned when a user attempts to access a web page that they have not paid for. Wikipedia reports the code is “reserved for future use” and that it was originally intended to be used by a digital payment system, despite no form of digital cash existing when the specification was drafted.Crypto commentator Marty Bent called it a ‘huge breakthrough’, writing:“When the Internet was originally designed, specifically HTTP, the architects envisioned that there would be a native payments layer built into the system. However, at the time, there was not a suitable digital cash system in existence that made this easy. Thus, the HTTP 402, or ‘Payment Required’ status code has practically never been used.”LSAT will spur a ‘new web’Osuntokun asserts that LSAT will power a “new web” in which “cryptographic bearer credentials” are purchased by users to access services — doing away with the current system of email addresses and passwords for accessing content online:“In this new web, credit cards no longer serve as a gatekeeper to all the amazing experiences that have been created on the web. LSATs enable the creation of a new more global, more private, more developer friendly web.”Bent agrees the potential is “massive”. “LSAT turns very manual processes into automatic API calls made by wallets, mobile apps, browsers, and extensions,” he wrote. “If brought to fruition and widely adopted, this will provide an incredible amount of utility for developers and users alike.”Alongside LSAT, Lightning Labs is launching ‘Aperture’ — described as “an HTTP 402 LSAT reverse proxy” that can be used to “upgrade an existing web resource or API to make It LSAT-enabled, creating a portal from the existing web to the new Lightning-native web.”"

Investors may simply be withdrawing their crypto to cold storage in the face of an uncertain market or BitMEX may have decided to reduce its own exposure to BTC. However the outflows could also signify a lack of confidence in BitMEX itself — following the crypto bloodbath liquidity on the exchange’s BTC futures dried up.Others suggest that it may simply be a result of large players and institutional investors deciding to get out of the space entirely during the current crisis.Investors moving Bitcoin to private wallets or liquidatingBitMEX isn’t the only exchange to see a drop in its Bitcoin holdings.

42385, New York Judge Says Telegram Can’t Distribute Grams Outside U.S. Either ,2020-04-02t04:25:00+01:00,3786,65,"A New York judge has ruled that the injunction barring Telegram from issuing its Gram tokens extends to all entities in the United State and overseas.On April 1, U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, responded to the encrypted messaging firm’s request for clarification as to the scope of the court’s March 24 preliminary injunction. He denied Telegram’s move to distribute tokens to the non-US-based participants of its 2018 initial coin offering (ICO).Approximately $1.27 billion of the funds raised to finance the development of the Telegram Open Network (TON) came from overseas-based investorsJudge Castel sides with SECThe court sided with the arguments laid out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to Telegram’s request for clarity.Judge Castel said that Telegram made no argument against the application of the preliminary injunction in its appeal and said the proposed form of the injunction — which would see Telegram prohibited from “delivering Grams to any person or entity” — had been known to the firm since October 2019.Court rejects Telegram’s bidThe court was unconvinced by Telegram’s claims that it could “implement safeguards” to prevent U.S-based investors from being able to access its Gram tokens.The judge noted that Telegram failed to demonstrate how the safeguards would comprise lawful modifications to its 2018 Gram Purchase Agreements. The court added that “the TON Blockchain was designed and is intended to grant anonymity to those who purchase or sell Grams,” asserting that “any restriction as to whom a foreign Initial Purchaser could resell Grams would be of doubtful real-world enforceability.”The judge also highlighted that Telegram’s proposals were made long after pre-injunction discovery had ended, preventing the SEC from being able to challenge the efficacy of the provisions offered by the firm.Ruling does not impact TON blockchainMichael Bacina, a partner in Piper Alderman’s Blockchain Group in Australia, told Cointelegraph that the “enforcement of any judgment of a Court outside of that Court’s jurisdiction can be challenging and involves each country’s legislation and treaties which can impact if (and how) a judgment may be enforced.” He added:“It would be surprising if the SEC would seek to enforce this decision in other jurisdictions given the time and expense required to do that. However, if there is evidence Telegram is distributing tokens in breach of the orders, they may find that the SEC seeks an order for contempt in the U.S. District Court against those involved in the distribution of Grams. Contempt is a serious matter and can result in arrest and jail time.”However, Bacina noted that the ruling does not concern the TON blockchain, stating: “The injunction only impacts the distribution of GRAMs, not the operation of the TON Blockchain itself, so Telegram’s plans to launch the mainnet should not be impacted, or be in breach of the orders, so long as Telegram does not distribute GRAMs which were part of the ICO.”Community may launch TON anywayThe TON community has suggested that it may launch the network itself despite the court’s ruling — with representative Fedor Skuratov telling Cointelegraph that “the community was ready for this scenario” on March 26.According to Skuratov, “no one can prevent the launch of TON by any other entity, person, or community, because TON is a decentralized open-source solution.”Skuratov added: “Already, there are two different test networks, and within the community, there is at least one group planning to launch.”"

It was a pretty convincing story too, thanks to a cleverly fabricated image of the ‘introduction’ to the whitepaper where Satoshi argues the economic system can come to a standstill “in times of severe economic recessions or by the outbreak of a novel virus”.But they happily admitted the story was fabricated at the end.Craig Wright is Satoshi #1Trust Wallet tweeted simply that Aussie Craig Wright has been confirmed as Satoshi Nakamoto .... before admitting in the next line it was just a joke.Craig Wright is Satoshi #2Finance Magnatesbroke the news ‘Craig Wright Victorious in Kleiman Case After Signing with Satoshi’s Key’.

Gangs demand a Bitcoin ransom in return for the decryption key. Hospitals are often seen as soft targets, due to ageing IT infrastructure and a willingness to pay due to the critical nature of their work.Cointelegraphreported on March 30 that Ryuk ransomware continues to target hospitals and healthcare providers based in the United States.Fighting against cyber attacks during the pandemicThe founder of the project, Ohad Zaidenberg, is based in Israel, while other members of the management team include Nate Warfield, Chris Mills, and Marc Rogers, who are based in the United States.Zaidenberg told Cointelegraph the League now has collaborators around the globe and that protecting hospitals was a critical need at this time:“Since the coronavirus crisis came out, I understood that attacking against the medical sector is a game-changer that can cause death. I decided to create a community of cybersecurity experts that want to spend their free time and to use their abilities to protect the medical sector. With my friends in the management team, we prove the real power of the infosec community. It gave us so much power to keep doing our job — to save a life.”Cryptocurrencies and ransomware attacksEarlier this month cybersecurity firm Emsisoft and incident response company Coveware also announced an initiative offering free ransomware decryption tools and assistance to health care providers in the event of an attack.The Emsisoft company blog implored ransomware crews to think twice before attacking healthcare organizations.“Make no mistake, an attack on a healthcare organization will have negative outcomes and may result in the loss of life.

It can’t be carried or divided easily, and is practically useless for micropayments, unless managed and overseen by a giant centralized network of processors and sorting offices (banks). In such a scenario, high transaction fees arise as a matter of course.P2P cash on the other hand is exactly what it sounds like: a currency that can be transacted between two people without the need of an intermediary.In practice, these philosophical differences manifest in the form of the Bitcoin block-size debate. The refusal of Bitcoin developers to increase the block size in order to scale on-chain resulted in high transaction fees, and prompted a sizable chunk of the community to hard fork the code into a new chain — Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Bitcoin transaction feesToday, Bitcoin fees are now among the highest in the cryptosphere. On March 1st, the average transaction fee was $0.40. By March 20th, it had risen to $1.76, according to data from Bitinfocharts.In the past 24 hours, average BTC transaction fees were anywhere between 617% and 645,900% higher than other major cryptocurrencies (ETH and XRP respectively).Source: BitinfochartsHowever, supporters of the digital gold narrative accept Bitcoin’s high fees and see it as a manifestation of the network’s high security which comes from Bitcoin’s dominant hashrate. High fees are more acceptable to users of ‘digital gold’, since they usually transact in larger amounts.Likewise, Buterin accepts the reality of BTC’s high fees, and suggests that now the digital gold use case has been established, people should simply use a different cryptocurrency forother use cases:“It was a controversial pivot executed without many participants' consent. It's certainly reasonable to be upset about it, though yes, now the pivot has happened, and if you don't like it you should just use one of the other blockchains whose community expresses different values.”More than 11 years on from the mining of Bitcoin’s genesis block, Satoshi Nakamoto’s original blueprint has been interpreted, re-interpreted, and built upon by numerous individuals, entrepreneurs and would-be pioneers.The beauty of blockchain mechanics is such that philosophical differences can be resolved practically, in the form of hard forks. The insistence of Bitcoin Core developers to keep the block size low, and maintain the digital gold narrative, has probably inspired more hard forks and more altcoin launches than any other phenomena in crypto — barring greed."

This sale was headed up by former Mozilla head, Brendan Eich.Cointelegraph reached out to Brave for additional details, but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in."
42368, CMT Digital Head Says BTC Trading Still Strong Despite Global Conditions ,2020-04-01t23:30:00+01:00,2405,79,"Amid global coronavirus fears and plunging mainstream markets, Bitcoin (BTC) trading has remained largely unchanged, according to CMT Digital head of trading and business development, Brad Koeppen.“Bitcoin trading has not been that different,” Koeppen told Cointelegraph in a March 31 email. “Volatility and volumes saw an uptick as BTC sold off with the traditional markets but high volatility is nothing new in Bitcoin.”Koeppen also referenced the problems seen on exchanges around the time of Bitcoin’s massive drop between March 11 and 13, noting that this is “nothing new” in the crypto space.Has Bitcoin decoupled from traditional markets?During Bitcoin’s massive dive in the first half of March, the coin seemingly moved in sync with selloffs in the mainstream market.“I am not surprised that Bitcoin traded in line with traditional markets during this crisis,” Koeppen said. “Liquidity is at a premium so people are selling all assets, including Bitcoin,” he included, adding:“Sometimes Bitcoin is the only market that is open so there have been a few moves in Bitcoin that did not coincide with a move in the traditional markets but I expect Bitcoin to have low or no correlation to traditional markets in the long run.”Over the past couple of weeks, Bitcoin’s price has moved somewhat independently from the overall bleedout endured by traditional markets.How does all this play into Bitcoin’s upcoming halving?Bitcoin is expected to complete a halving event around May 2020. Some folks see the event as an indication that prices will soon increase, noting that the halving inherently means a decrease in the number of new coins regularly entering the ecosystem. Historically, the asset has indeed risen in price following previous halvings.Current global coronavirus fears, matched with traditional market uncertainty, however, could factor into upcoming developments.“The halving is a highly anticipated moment in Bitcoin's lifecycle,” Koeppen said. “I do not have a view on the price direction leading up to the halving but I think that there will be increased activity in the markets,” Koeppen added, explaining:“Bitcoin markets are full of speculators and the halving will bring out more participants looking to speculate on the price; this could lead to prolonged volatility in the markets. I think the halving will have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin in the long run. I don't think the event itself should have a major impact on price.”The industry holds a mixed bag of expectations for the event. Many note that Bitcoin is a much more mainstream asset than it was during the previous halving four years ago."
42367, U.S. Crypto ATM Network Helps to Promote Social Distancing ,2020-04-01t22:30:00+01:00,2574,122,"Bitcoin Depot, the largest Bitcoin ATM operator in the world, has begun powering down some of its machines in an effort to halt further spread of COVID-19.As much of the world sits in quarantine, Bitcoin Depot has chosen to temporarily shut off crypto ATMs which specifically reside in high traffic areas. The company is undertaking this push as a way to encourage social distancing.“As we monitor the ongoing situation, the number of locations temporarily taken offline will likely increase,” Bitcoin Depot’s director of product, Alona Lubovnaya, told Cointelegraph in an email, adding:“We are continuing to monitor for locations that inhibit our users from socially distancing themselves from others. We estimate 10% of our machines will be in temporary lockdown until the end of April, or until further notice.”Bitcoin Depot reportedly touts more than 600 Bitcoin ATMs, also called BTMs, in a network which spans 25 U.S. states.Crypto ATMs on the riseIn recent years, crypto ATM numbers have flourished globally. These machines allow customers to trade their fiat dollars for cryptocurrency at physical machines across the globe.At the beginning of March 2019, the world boasted 7,014 BTMs. As of press time, that number has grown to 7,384 machines, CoinATMRadar data indicates.“Our goal is to contribute to the safety and health of our users by maintaining strong protocols with regard to the cleanliness of our machines,” Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz said, in light of the global coronavirus pandemic.Mintz added:“In this case, that means powering down certain BTMs in order to prevent the spread of the current pandemic. We hope other Bitcoin ATM operators will follow our lead and do everything in their power to keep customers safe.”Digital assets organically encourage social distancingBy nature, cryptocurrencies do not require a social presence. Users can send value directly from one person or entity to the next, without ever meeting them.Bitcoin ATMs serve a purpose, in that they allow users to buy into and cash out of Blockchain assets. This helps expand digital payment access to the underbanked, many of whom are otherwise unable to transact online. It can also enable payment at establishments that do not accept virtual currency.Bitcoin ATMs can also lead to close contact between users, however, when they are placed in high traffic social venues, such as malls. Screens and other touchpoints can also facilitate the spread of viral illnesses if they are not kept clean.Bitcoin Depot has delegated a specific team for locking machines during the coronavirus pandemic. “We also have our best field technicians working tirelessly to disinfect and clean our affected BTM’s,” Lubovnaya added.Recently, the U.S. President extended the emergency shut down of all non-essential businesses from April 12 until the end of the month."
42366," FBI Arrests Russian Rapper For Crypto Money Laundering, Cites Damning Instagram ",2020-04-01t21:36:00+01:00,4689,134,"United States authorities have arrested a Russian national under allegations of money laundering — using his Instagram that promoted his rap career as evidence against him.Per court filings unsealed on March 30, an FBI investigator alleged that Maksim Boiko laundered money using cryptocurrencies, including via disgraced exchange BTC-e. The authorities also say that Boiko conspired with transnational organized crime organization QQAAZZ.Initial detainment in Miami airport in JanuarySeemingly a resident of Los Angeles, Boiko entered the U.S. on January 19 carrying $20,000 in cash. According to the FBI affidavit, Boiko told airport security that his money came from investments in Bitcoin and rental properties in Russia.Skeptical of this explanation, authorities would go on to arrest Boiko in Miami on March 27.Rap career and questionable source of incomeWhat the filings do not mention is that Boiko is also a small-time rapper operating under the name Plinofficial — a name also used in an email address that the FBI identified as being connected with money laundering operations.Boiko had allegedly used email address plinofficial@me.com to register an account on BTC-e under his real name. According to the FBI, “data from BTC-e showed that Boiko’s account had received $387,964 worth of deposits and had withdrawn approximately 136 Bitcoin.”As of press time, Plinoffial’s Youtube account had 336 subscribers, while his Instagram has 2,363.Social media evidenceBoiko’s social media presence was apparently a factor in the investigation. The FBI investigator testifying against Boiko said pictures from his Instagram are:“Inconsistent with the practices of a legitimate business operation and are consistent with the allegations set forth herein that Boiko has engaged in illegal money laundering activities with significant cybercriminals for the past several years.”Indeed, Boiko seems very fond of pictures of him holding large wads of cash.

Compared to that, Bitcoin only fell about 10% over the same period, which shows clear outperformance. The resilience of Bitcoin (BTC) in the current crisis shows that it has arrived on the big scene and that it can weather a storm better than some of the traditional asset classes. This is likely to attract several institutional players to Bitcoin.Now, what can we hope for during the second quarter? Bitcoin has a very important halving event coming up next month. This has been positive for the price action during the previous two halvings. This time, however, analysts are divided. Nonetheless, the second quarter, barring the dip in 2018, has always closed in the green. This shows that cyclically, Bitcoin’s price is likely to rise in this quarter.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360Another positive is that crypto traders are buying the dips instead of panicking and dumping their positions. A report by Coinbase shows that there was record-breaking trading activity during and after the crash on March 12. Bitcoin’s trading surged to six times the average during this period and the number of active traders also swelled to 3 1/2 times the average.While the buyers are keen to enter on dips, is the buying interest sustaining at higher levels or will the cryptocurrencies revisit their recent lows? Let’s study the charts to find out.BTC/USDThe bears are not allowing Bitcoin (BTC) to sustain above the 20-day exponential moving average. This is a negative sign. Both the weighted and exponential moving averages are sloping down and the relative strength index is in the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.BTC–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the BTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plummets below the support at $5,660.47, a retest of the critical long-term support at $5,000 is possible. Therefore, the stops on the long positions can be kept at $5,600.Conversely, if the pair turns around from the current levels or bounces off the support at $5,660.47, the bulls will try to carry it to the stiff psychological resistance at $7,000. A breakout of this level will be a huge positive and is likely to result in a rally to $9,000. Though the 50-day simple moving average at $7,837 might act as a resistance, we expect it to be crossed.ETH/USDEther (ETH) has formed a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $117.09. This setup has a target objective of $81.78, but we anticipate the bulls to aggressively defend the critical support at $84.25.ETH–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewConversely, if the bulls can drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USD pair can retest the overhead resistance at $155.612.A breakout of $155.612 is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the pair to the 50-day SMA at $194 and above it to $250. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions as suggested in our earlier analysis.XRP/USDXRP is struggling to scale and sustain above the overhead resistance at $0.17468. This shows that the bears are defending this level. If the price turns down from the current levels, the bears will try to sink it below $0.16. If successful, a drop to $0.1275 is possible.XRP–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewHowever, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers.The advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls if the XRP/USD pair breaks above $0.18867, which is the intraday high of March 27. Above this level, a move to the 50-day SMA at $0.216 and above it to $0.25 is possible.Traders who own long positions can keep a protective stop loss at $0.143. The stops can be trailed higher to $0.16 if the pair breaks out above $0.19.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been clinging to the 20-day EMA for the past few days but has failed to scale above it. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the current levels, a drop to $200 or below it, to $166, is possible.BCH–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewConversely, if the bulls can propel the BCH/USD pair above the 20-day EMA, a move to $247.95 is likely. A breakout of this level is likely to result in a rally to the 50-day SMA at $294 and above it to $350. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) bounced strongly from the support at $146.96 on March 30, but the bulls could not sustain the price above the 20-day EMA at $167.82. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the zone between the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance at $185.87.BSV–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support at $146.96, a drop to $120 is possible.

There is resistance at the 50-day SMA, but we expect it to be crossed.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) is stuck between the 20-day EMA and the support at $35.8582. If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA at $40.69, a retest of $43.67 is possible. A break above this will signal the start of a new uptrend.LTC–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewTherefore, the traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $43.67 and keep a stop loss at $35. The first target objective is a rally to the 50-day SMA at $54.16 — and above it, the up move can extend to $63.8769.However, if the price turns down either from the 20-day EMA or $43.67 and plummets below $35.8582, a drop to $30 is likely.EOS/USDEOS has extended its stay inside the $2.0632-$2.4001 range. After this tight range trading, we anticipate a range expansion within the next few days. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout. Hence, it is better to wait for the breakout to happen before taking a trade.EOS–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the EOS/USD pair breaks above the overhead resistance at $2.4001, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. Above this level, a move to the 50-day SMA at $3.20 or above it, to $3.86, is likely. Hence, we have retained the buy proposed in an earlier analysis.Conversely, if the range expands to the downside and slips below the support at $2.0632, a drop to $1.7213 is possible.BNB/USDBinance Coin (BNB) is currently stuck between the 20-day EMA and the horizontal support at $10.8427. If the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, a move to $13.65 or above it, to the downtrend line, is possible.BNB–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWe anticipate the bears to defend the zone between $13.65 and the downtrend line. A break above this zone will be the first sign that the advantage is tilting in favor of the bulls.However, if the BNB/USD pair turns down from $13.65 or the downtrend line, it might spend some more time in consolidation. The pair will turn negative on a break below $10.8427.XTZ/USDTezos (XTZ) has been trading between $1.4453 and $1.955 for the past few days. Though the bulls have managed to defend the support at $1.4453, they have not been able to push the price above the 20-day EMA, which suggests a lack of buying at higher levels.XTZ–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls again fail to scale the price above the 20-day EMA, a retest of $1.4453 is likely. If this support breaks, it will complete a small descending triangle pattern, which can drag the price toward the recent lows.Conversely, if the XTZ/USD pair rises above the 20-day EMA, a move to $1.955 is possible. The pair will pick up momentum on a break above the downtrend line.Therefore, the traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above the downtrend line before initiating long positions. The stops can be kept at $1.40 and the first target objective is the 50-day SMA at $2.43 — and if this is crossed, the next level to watch out for is $3.20.LEO/USDUnus Sed Leo (LEO) broke out and closed (UTC time) above $1.04, thus completing the inverse head and shoulders pattern on March 30. This triggered our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.LEO–USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThough the bulls have maintained the price above the breakout level of $1.04 for the past two days, the failure to run up shows hesitation at higher levels. If the LEO/USD pair fails to pick up momentum, the bears are likely to sink it back below $1.04.If the price slides below $1.04, the first support is at the 20-day EMA at $1.016, and the second at $1. If the bulls fail to defend these support levels, the pair is likely to dip to the 50-day SMA at $0.987 or below it, to $0.95.

42353, A Crypto Venture Fund Bought the Most Tokens at MakerDAO’s Debt Auction ,2020-04-01t19:21:00+01:00,2209,59,"An auction to recapitalize MakerDAO (MKR) after the mid-March market turmoil successfully concluded on March 28, bringing in over $5 million worth of DAI. Crypto venture fund Paradigm Capital revealed in a March 31 tweet that it won approximately 68% of the auctioned tokens.The company had previously pledged to join a “backstop syndicate” and cover the entire system shortfall if necessary. Acting as a so-called “backstop,” the group would act as the buyer of last resort by purchasing the MKR tokens if their price fell to $100. (The auction’s starting price was $200 and the current market price is $288.)Many prominent members of the decentralized finance (DeFi) community joined the syndicate, guaranteeing that Paradigm would not have been alone in its effort to preserve MakerDAO’s functionality. But the backstop was ultimately unnecessary because the auction found lots of bidders quickly. Some community members alleged that the Maker Foundation was purchasing the lots, as most of the bids came from a select few addresses.The foundation responded by saying that it provided “limited technical assistance to some bidders.” It is unknown if Paradigm, a major Maker Foundation investor, needed that assistance. Representatives from the fund did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The article will be updated when we learn more.The system is recapitalized, but the users aren’tThe Black Thursday market collapse had two sides of losses to it. At a protocol level, MakerDAO became undercollateralized by $5 million as the collateral bids for zero DAI clearly did not return a sufficient amount of DAI to Maker, compromising the stability of its peg to the U.S. dollar. Though in reality, market events broke the peg in the opposite direction as DAI traded at a premium.While the auction successfully recapitalized the system, the individual users who got liquidated lost more than the 13% that MakerDAO advertises, and they have not been compensated yet. Their total losses are between an estimated $1 million and $3 million.The MakerDAO community is currently in the process of deciding how much money token holders should return to the users, if anything at all.A previously held poll concluded with the vast majority being in favor of a compensation, and more than 60% deciding to compensate all losses. Nevertheless, the discussion continued as the poll is not binding — Maker’s governance is finalized on-chain.The community is now deciding the wording for the on-chain voting, where MKR holders will express an opinion weighted by their stake in the system.Some members are concerned of setting a “dangerous precedent” of having to compensate users for any loss, while maintaining that they were expected to react and know the risks.These debates highlight some of the differences between Maker users and the protocol’s maintainers. The users are not expected to be tech-savvy, while the software for joining the auctions requires programming knowledge in order to be used — at least for now."

Celo network has the right specifications for this kind of approach. This grant will help us implement the initial pilots, enabling us to go further and expand to more communities.”Celo plans to distribute at least $15.7 million in grant funding during 2020Applications for the current round of grant funding close on May 19, with Celo planning to award 15.7 million cGLD in community grants over its first year.Cazador states that 100 million cGLD are expected to be allocated to developers building on Celo over the lifetime of the project, with a further 100 million tokens “expected to go towards the community as a portion of on-chain epoch rewards, allocated through on-chain governance.”Once mainnet has launched, Celo grants will be disbursed using either cGLD or the network’s stablecoin cUSD. Celo is issuing cGLD tokens via Dutch auction with a reserve price of $1.Looking forward, Cazador states that 2020 will be “an exciting year with mainnet launch approaching [and] Celo gold and Celo dollars going live after mainnet release and all the governance actions have been completed.”“In addition to mainnet, we expect to see teams continue to build on and integrate with the Celo Platform with the Celo Alliance for Prosperity, Ecosystem Fund and 2nd wave of the Celo Foundation Grants program,” he adds."

42343, Fed’s Quantitative Easing Strategy Holds Long-Term Benefits for Crypto ,2020-04-01t16:29:00+01:00,4690,146,"These are perilous times, and it hasn’t escaped anyone’s notice that the United States Federal Reserve is doing its part to alleviate the suffering — which began with the coronavirus pandemic and has spread to the global economy. It’s printing more money.“There is an infinite amount of cash at the Federal Reserve,” Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told Scott Pelley of CBS on March 22, adding: “We will do whatever we need to do to make sure there is enough cash in the financial system.”The U.S. Federal Reserve itself reinforced that message on March 23, announcing that it would “continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.”The death of capitalism?Reactions to these affirmations of quantitative easing, or QE, have been swift from sectors of the crypto community: “With these words, the last vestige of #capitalism died in the US,” wrote Caitlin Long, who established the first crypto-native bank in the United States. “[The] Fed’s monetization U.S. debt is now unlimited.”Mati Greenspan, the CEO and co-founder of Quantum Economics told Cointelegraph: “The Fed said it is willing to buy the entire market” if necessary to stabilize markets. Meanwhile, on the fiscal side, Congress’s $2 trillion stimulus package includes handouts like “helicopter money” — i.e., a $1,200 payment to every tax-paying adult who has an annual income below $75,000. “Inflation is pretty much a foregone conclusion at this point,” he stated elsewhere.Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com, told Cointelegraph: “The response by central banks to COVID-19 is truly unprecedented, with Fed and Bank of England officials using terms like ‘infinite,’ ‘unlimited’ and ‘radical.’” They’ve been using such extraordinary language in the hope they’ll prevent equity and credit markets from seizing up. “Only time will tell if they have gone too far.”The U.S. dollar is dominantIs inflation really imminent, though? Not if one recognizes that the global demand for U.S. dollars continues to exceed supply. As Civic CEO Vinny Lingham told Cointelegraph: “The reality is: Everyone needs to reprice assets, and they need to do it in U.S. dollars.”Lingham grew up in South Africa. He saw what happened with hyperinflation in neighboring Zimbabwe where “the demand for stable currency exceeded everything else.” With people in the grip of the current pandemic, entire business sectors have been shutting down all over the world. People have been selling assets whether it’s equities, collectible classic cars or Bitcoin (BTC). Lingham added:“If I’m living in South Africa, I may have kept money in the form of a bar of gold that is priced in Rands. Now I’m selling it for local Rands and buying U.S. dollars with those Rands. As the Rand devalues, the dollar gets stronger.”Under such conditions, “if the Federal Reserve prints another $2 trillion USD, it’s okay,” said Lingham. Greenspan agrees that the U.S. dollar has been the world’s most in-demand financial asset in recent weeks, and theoretically, the Fed could print trillions more than it is currently proposing — and there may not be any hyperinflation. The problem is that no one knows what the “stop point” is — i.e., how much is too much. “We won’t know [hyperinflation is] happening until it’s too late.”BTC as a store of value?What does all of this mean for cryptocurrencies? Many in the crypto world assume that Bitcoin, with its fixed maximum supply — 21 million BTC — is bound to come out ahead if the Fed and other central banks print too much money. “Though that assumption has not been tested in real-time except in Venezuela,” said Greenspan. If you had bought BTC at its low point in Venezuelan bolivars and had sold BTC at its height, also for bolivars, you would have come out way ahead. It’s not clear that this case can be generalized, though. During the current crisis, BTC and other cryptocurrencies have plunged dramatically, just like equities — which has somewhat damaged Bitcoin’s claim of being a store of value.The current economic environment is not favorable for any asset class, Lingham observed. Bitcoin i3s now positively correlated with other asset classes. Greenspan said the correlation between BTC and the stock market has recently reached a high point of 0.6 — with 1.0 representing perfect positive correlation. If this were not the case, BTC would currently be priced somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000, Lingham suggested.Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, told Cointelegraph that he understands this moment is critical for the future of cryptocurrencies:“U.S. equity markets have suddenly become as volatile as Bitcoin markets, and the U.S. government is undertaking a large scale intervention that involves a massive expansion of the money supply which in the absence of other major shocks (the economic shutdown due to the pandemic), would normally induce a large increase in the inflation rate.”However, Zetlin-Jones does not see these developments causing Bitcoin to emerge as a leading store of value because in the long run: “Bitcoin is one of the riskiest stores of value in the world, with Bitcoin price volatility more than five times that of both gold or even U.S. equity prices.” Kevin Dowd, a professor of finance and economics at Durham University in the United Kingdom, told Cointelegraph:“BTC does offer an alternative store of value, and there is no question about that. The issue is: How good is it? It all depends upon when you buy and when you sell, and so there remains a huge element of luck.”According to Hileman, the University of Cambridge’s first “cryptocurrency academic,” the prices of gold and Bitcoin should both rise:“Even before COVID-19, we felt the unprecedented level of public and private debts made Bitcoin, and hard assets in general, attractive. Historically, recessions and large fiscal and monetary expansions have driven up the price of hard assets like gold. [...] We do not see a reason why this time should be any different.”The future of crypto?It is still too early to gauge the impact of QE on crypto, said Greenspan. “The initial shock of the global economy grinding to a halt” is still too fresh. “The long-term trend is yet to emerge.”Moreover, BTC is just a small part of the story, though it has held its value well compared with other asset classes, Greenspan told Cointelegraph.People have been struggling, and many individuals are selling everything they can, said Lingham. “Until there is excess capital, Bitcoin is in the same basket as other assets. There will be no mad rush to get into cryptocurrency unless the U.S. dollar falters” — and then, only maybe.“I would be surprised if BTC bit the dust due to the current crisis, but you cannot rule anything out,” said Dowd, who has maintained in the past that Bitcoin’s price must go to zero in the long term — principally because its mining model, a natural monopoly, is unsustainable.In the short term, meanwhile: “The injection of money tends to float all markets, and that includes crypto,” said Greenspan. “Stocks will be first, but [the fiscal stimulus] is also likely to push up the price of BTC.”A more decentralized global economy?The current crisis might eventually impel structural changes in the world economy, however, and these could change the crypto and blockchain space — for the better. Zetlin-Jones told Cointelegraph that once the recovery begins, a new way has to be found:“We will need a more robust economy — one where supply chains are less dependent on a single producer, where workers are less dependent on the operations of a single firm, where individuals are less dependent on a single source of health care.”These are effective movements toward a more decentralized world economy, in which blockchain technology seems uniquely poised to play a key role, Zetlin-Jones said. “They might speed up the demand for blockchain solutions and, therefore, [improve] the long-run viability of blockchains and their associated cryptocurrencies."
42340, Amended Ripple Class-Action Covers Possibility XRP Is Not a Security ,2020-04-01t16:05:00+01:00,6270,177,"An amendment to the class-action lawsuit against Ripple, filed March 25, included additional claims of false advertising and unfair competition, “under the alternative theory that XRP is not a security.”The disgruntled investors’ sixth and seventh claims for relief would appear to be a direct hedge in the event that the judge rules against the original suit suggesting that XRP was illegally sold as an unregistered security.Hedging their betsThe filing included two additional claims for relief, in relation to alleged false advertising and unfair competition, both in violation of the California Business and Professions Code.These additional claims for relief both state that they are being brought “under the alternative theory that XRP is not a security.”The claims act as a hedge for the possibility of the judge ruling that this is the case.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the amended filing also included the additional claim that Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, was touting XRP to prospective investors while silently liquidating his holdings.Covering old grounds?The long-running lawsuit was originally filed back in November 2018, although after much legal wrangling, it was only given the go-ahead to finally proceed in February this year.Ripple’s motion for the case to be dismissed was only partially granted by the District Court judge, allowing the allegation that the XRP token was sold as an unregistered security to move forward.However, the claims which the judge did see fit to throw out included those of false advertising, and violation of California state law. The amended claims of false advertising and violation of state law are virtually identical in essence, other than relying on the theory that XRP is not a security."
42333, Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator Director on What DLT Startups Need to Succeed ,2020-04-01t14:27:00+01:00,1823,71,"The Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator — an incubator for early stage distributed ledger technology startups at the University of California, Berkeley — recently launched its spring cohort, which includes startups seeking to fight COVID-19, launch a cannabis-themed massively multiplayer online game and create a reverse auction platform for loans.Cointelegraph spoke to Jocelyn Weber, the director of the Xcelerator, to find out more about the resources the program offers to startups, success stories from previous cohorts and advice for startups looking to launch in the crypto space.Cointelegraph: Could you give an overview of the engagement and resources available to startups participating in the Xcelerator?Jocelyn Weber: Our mission at Berkeley is to provide education and opportunity creation for our students and for the teams that join us and the Xcelerator.So, we're kind of a platform that serves two sides: the student community, which ranges from undergraduate to Ph.D. and faculty level; and then on the other side of the platform are the startups, which can come to us to find blockchain talent funding, entrepreneurial guidance partners and even users for their products.On campus, we have blockchain researchers, the Blockchain at Berkeley student group and a variety of blockchain courses. We have workshops on campus from the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, which is led by Shafi Goldwasser, who is the co-inventor of zero-knowledge proofs.We have an ecosystem calendar now on the Xcelerator website that shows you kind of all the activity that's taking place on a month-to-month basis. And a lot of that activity is open to the community and anyone can join.We invite our startups to engage in these activities with us on our campus, and we mix in people from our network, which includes venture firms and corporates such as Samsung, Next and Oracle.CT: Can you give some more examples of the venture capital firms and crypto companies that are in UC Berkeley’s network?JW: We've had Harmony, Near, Cosmos, Affinity and Polkadot all speak on campus over the last year and a half. We also involve exchanges, regulatory and legal advisors, and a host of mentors. We also have a Blockchain at Berkeley student fellowship program that pairs some of our top blockchain Berkeley students with each Xcelerator team.“To stimulate the interaction among all these stakeholders, we invite them to our open monthly meetups, to speak on panels or in speaker sessions and, when appropriate, to mentor directly with the teams or hold office hours.”Our accelerator also draws from our Berkeley Entrepreneurs Association network to teach a range of topics, including customer discovery, marketing for startups, design thinking and how to best interact with VCs in Silicon Valley. We've also had close to eight VC panels or VC speaking sessions. Those have included Blockchain Capital, Monday Capital, Future Perfect Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Robinhood Crypto and Dekrypt Capital.CT: When assessing applications from startups, what are some of the things you look for when identifying teams/projects that are of high quality or have strong potential?JW: We look a lot at “founder, problem, fit”: do the founders really have the leadership in their team with the experience, the blockchain background and the network to win in their market or use case?We also want to see that it's not technology for technology's sake, that it really is a viable business. And we like to see some customer market validation data. Although it's still early in the blockchain space, many of our teams have had a chance to go out and get early adopter customers. So we like to see that in the teams that we select.We also receive recommendations from some of the projects that we are in touch with. Near, Ripple, Stellar, Parity and Polkadot have all recommended projects to us in the past, which is helpful because they certainly know in their own ecosystems who is doing good work.CT: What are some of the biggest challenges that the Xcelerator has found blockchain startups frequently encounter?JW: Market timing for broader adoption is a challenge that the entire blockchain industry is facing. Certainly, our teams see that. They have these early adopters and early traction, and what we're waiting for is the broader market timing.Also, in some cases, the customers' understanding of the technology. Sometimes you have blockchain being applied to a legacy industry that's not familiar with the technology, and there is a little bit of education that needs to take place by the startup for these legacy industries so that they can understand the benefits of blockchain. So, you see a lot of customer education also being done by our startups.CT: Can you share some success stories from previous cohorts?JW: Leaf Global Fintech, a global virtual bank that helps refugees and migrants safely store and transport money across borders, was in our fall batch. They have launched and gained traction. They've also received a $225,000 phase one non-dilutive grant from the National Science Foundation in the United States. We were excited that they were able to raise that non-dilutive support.PlayTable was in our first batch, and they raised over $3 million with a new token issuance that included investors like VeChain and Block Crafters. We also had Bitmark from our first batch raise $3 million dollars.CT: Have many former cohort members been able to raise capital after participating in the Xcelerator?JW: From our first batch, we had 12 teams in total. Three were student-led teams that primarily went on with education. We had one team that had done an initial coin offering and didn't need additional funding, and eight went on to seek additional capital. Five of the eight have been successful in raising new capital. I hope that two more will raise in the next few months, as they were pretty far along in the fundraising process just before COVID-19 affected the U.S. and Europe.From the second batch, there was RIPchain, or rest-in-peace chain. They are putting wills and trusts on the blockchain. A very young team of 17-year-old twins doing some great work. I expect we'll hear more from them.Many of our other teams from that fall batch are still working on fundraising, as we ended in mid-December. With COVID-19, we will see some slowing of that progress, but I expect that a good number of them will go on to raise over the next 10 months.Finally, another key result that we've noticed is the hiring activity taking place. A new number of our UC Berkeley students at all levels are being hired by our startups, as well as companies that have sponsored events or spoken on panels. We're really thrilled to see this opportunity creation through our network.CT: What lessons has the Xcelerator learned since the first cohort, and what adjustments have been made to the program?JW: It's been just over a year, but we have made some adjustments. We were trying to follow semester boundaries, and that put us with a demo day in mid-December at the end of last year, which we learned was not an optimal time for venture capital engagement. So, we are changing that, and that's why we're starting in April and ending around October for our spring batch.“We've also learned that involving the blockchain VC community on panels and speaking sessions on campus is really helpful to understand their perspectives, educate ourselves when we're selecting teams, and also to educate our teams on where VCs are most interested and what their views are.”So, it's helpful to have that dialogue between the VC community, especially the blockchain VC community, and our teams.CT: Do you have any predictions for the blockchain sector in the coming years?JW: We think security in the decentralized finance space needs to be addressed for broader adoption. We also saw a very high volume of gaming from ghost applications in the current batch of applications.“We are excited about the gaming space. We have four teams in the current batch working on gaming-related solutions or nonfungible tokens, and we think this is a great opportunity for broader consumer adoption of crypto and NFTs.”And finally, like most of the industry today, we see that activity will move toward application-specific blockchains with architectures that are best suited for particular use cases. And then 12 to 18 months after many of these new layer one chains launch their mainnet, it will be very interesting to see what works well.CT: What advice would you give to early startups or entrepreneurs who are thinking about building in the blockchain and crypto industries?JW: I'd give the typical startup or new venture considerations: Ensure you have a scalable business model through the customer discovery process before you do extensive product development. Understand your market and the dynamics in that market extremely well.And build a network of potential investors, advisors, mentors and partners as early as possible in the process. We feel the network that teams establish is really key to their success.“If you're a decentralized application, stay layer-one agnostic or flexible as long as you can, as some layer ones may end up being more successful or more appropriate for your solution in the long run.”This interview was shortened and slightly edited for clarity."
42330," Cardano's Byron Reboot Goes Live, Paving Way to Shelley Mainnet ",2020-04-01t13:16:00+01:00,6931,126,"Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain Cardano (ADA) went live with its Byron reboot yesterday, March 30, as the project prepares its transition to the Shelley mainnet.Announced by Cardano’s developer, the peer-to-peer technology firm Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the reboot involves a series of updates to major components of the Cardano network — the Cardano node, explorer, and Daedalus wallet backend, which is being spun out as a new version, Daedalus Flight.A process, not an eventIn an outline of the reboot’s significance, which has taken 18 months to complete, IOHK explained that the new design is, “modular, separating the ledger, consensus, and network components of the node, allowing any one of them to be changed, tweaked, and upgraded without affecting the others.”In lieu of improving the existing code, the reboot was made by working “from scratch,” with all critical elements of the new Cardano node formally specified.Changes to the wallet’s backend and services have been grouped together as “Adrestia,” offering exchanges and third-party developers to use a collection of independent, self-contained libraries to interact with the Cardano network.APIs have been extended and specifically designed with larger exchanges in mind, and Daedalus will now include Yoroi wallet support — thereby supporting features such as transaction filtering and parallel wallet restoration.A new rolling release of Daedalus will provide scope for users to test the new node functionality and wallet backend and offer their feedback to IOKH, which has pledged to implement improvements in response.Overall, IOHK claims the reboot will result in performance improvements and higher transaction throughput capacity — i.e. how much demand the network can manage in terms of transactions per second.The developers are also eyeing a reduction in barriers to entry by making the Cardano node more efficient in terms of memory usage, thus enabling users with lower-spec hardware to participate in the network and helping to ensure greater levels of decentralization.IOHK describes the reboot as more of a process than a discrete event, noting that its “goal is to gradually and sustainably migrate the entire Cardano blockchain to working on the new node implementation, without any disruption or loss of service.”Following this process, IOHK plans to focus on the Haskett Shelley testnet, including the onboarding of stake pool operators to incentivize them to prepare for running on the future Shelley mainnet.Decentralization maxAs reported, IOHK was founded by the mathematician, cryptographer and entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson in 2015. Also a co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson told Cointelegraph in an interview this February that his aim is to make Cardano 50 to 100 times more decentralized than Bitcoin once all its upgrades are implemented."
42329, AT&T Seeks Dismissal of $200M in Damages for 2018 SIM-Swap Attack ,2020-04-01t12:30:00+01:00,3705,71,"AT&T is again seeking to have punitive damages claims of $200 million dismissed in an ongoing court case between the telecoms giant and crypto investor Michael Terpin — who asserts he lost $24 million in crypto as a result of AT&T’s negligence in 2018.In response to Terpin’s second amended complaint — filed with the court on March 16, AT&T is seeking to have two of his eight claims dismissed, alongside $200 million in punitive damage claims.Speaking to Cointelegraph, AT&T’s Jim Kimberley stated: “Fraudulent SIM swaps are a form of theft committed by sophisticated criminals. It is unfortunate that these criminals targeted Mr. Terpin, but we dispute his allegations and will continue to fight them in court.”AT&T pushes back against two of eight claimsDuring a March 30 hearing, AT&T’s representation asserted that the amended complaint fails to address the flaws with Terpin’s previous complaint, arguing that Terpin does not adequately demonstrate that the telecoms firm is guilty of deceit by concealment or deceit by misrepresentation.“Mr. Terpin ignores the undisputed fact [...] that AT&T disclosed to him that it could not guarantee that third parties would not take unauthorized actions that would disclose his personal information,” AT&T argued, adding:""Mr. Terpin’s deceit and misrepresentation claims seek to punish AT&T not for concealing or misrepresenting material facts, but simply for failing to provide further specifics on how Mr. Terpin’s information could be stolen.""AT&T’s lawyers are also seeking the dismissal of $200 million in damagesTerpin submits second amended complaintTerpin, a prominent crypto investor who founded BitAngels in 2013, first filed his complaint against AT&T in August 2018 — presenting 16 claims against the company.Judge Wright dismissed 13 of the 16 claims in July 2019, before Terpin filed an amended complaint the following month bringing nine claims.Terpin’s second amended complaint seeks to demonstrate that the company was aware of and disregarded the prevalence of SIM-swap attacks resulting from its employees' actions.During June 2017, hackers were able to gain control of the investor’s phone number through a SIM-swapping attack.By impersonating Terpin using the compromised device, the hackers were able to convince one of the investor's clients to send them cryptocurrency. Terpin’s account was then placed on a “higher security level with special protection” after he met with AT&T representatives concerning the attack.On Jan. 7, 2018, Terpin’s phone was hacked for a second time — which the investor alleges was facilitated by an employee of AT&T — resulting in the loss of nearly $24 million in digital assets after Terpin’s 2-Factor Authentication passwords were reset by the hackers.Terpin: AT&T presented no new argumentsSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Terpin asserts that his most recent filing “shows the many ways that AT&T had sufficient knowledge of and a moral responsibility to act upon the vast number of SIM-related crimes inflicted upon its customers that law enforcement has been informing them of, substantiating the claim for punitive damages.” He continues:“It is also bizarre for AT&T to quote its original boilerplate contract language signed in one store several decades ago when it made a new agreement in another store more recently to secure my digital identity with a 'higher security' program to safeguard against a future SIM swap — without disclosing that this feature could easily be defeated by any AT&T store clerk who is bribed or tricked by a criminal gang."""
42328," Bitcoin Codebase Preserved for 1,000 Years in Archive Under Arctic Ice ",2020-04-01t11:50:00+01:00,5530,208,"A snapshot of the Bitcoin codebase will be encoded onto film reels and stored for a thousand years under the arctic ice in Svalbard, Norway. The move is part of the GitHub Archive Program, with a mission to preserve open-source software, for future generations to learn about the culture of today.GitHub has partnered with institutions such as the Software Heritage Foundation, Arctic World Archive, and Oxford University’s Bodleian Library to ensure the long-term preservation of code, which could otherwise be abandoned, forgotten or lost.With the ephemeral nature of much of today’s modern storage media, a solution requires the archiving of software across multiple organizations and longer-term storage forms. Online archivists use the acronym LOCKSS for this, which stands for ""Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe.""Storage layers from hot to coldThe program has adopted a ""pace layers"" strategy, to maximize both flexibility and durability. Every push to GitHub triggers the replication of data to multiple global data centers, and all of this data is available live and in real-time. This comprises the most active ""hot"" layer.The ""warm"" layers include solutions such as the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which update archived copies somewhere between a monthly and annual basis. These also archive across multiple geographical locations.The ""cold"" storage layers will only be updated every five or more years, and the Arctic World Archive (AWA) is one of these. On Feb. 2, 2020, a snapshot of every active GitHub repository was taken.These will be encoded onto 3,500-foot film reels by a Norwegian company called Piql, which specializes in very-long-term data storage. The film reels will be stored 250 meters deep in AWA’s decommissioned coal mine under the arctic permafrost on the island of Svalbard. The Arctic Code Vault is just a mile away from the famous Global Seed Vault.Backups of backups of backupsDuplicates of the film reels archiving the Bitcoin codebase along with the other top 10,000 most starred and depended-upon repositories, will be held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, providing redundancy for the Arctic Code Vault.The ultimate aim of the program is to archive all public repositories for 10,000 years, through a partnership with Microsoft’s Project Silica. This will involve etching them into quartz glass platters with femtosecond lasers.As the cryptocurrency industry is built on values of openness and transparency, a great many of the projects in the space are released as open-source, GitHub being the main repository for these.The efforts to create a very-long-term archive of this code should prevent a loss of current technologies while ensuring that future historians can learn about the pressing projects of today."

He said:“According to new regulations we would need to have a local compliance officer who must prove an impeccable business reputation — i.e. provide supporting documents regarding education, skills [...] The local management board must [also] have a good reputation.”These new requirements, he said, proved somewhat tricky, but the exchange was able to hire an appropriate compliance officer, as well as to establish a physical office in Estonia — a “mandatory part of the new compliance process.”BuyUCoin now reportedly plans to extend its platform to foreign jurisdictions with an existing legal and regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.A positive climate for cryptoNews of BuyUcoin’s regulatory approval and partnership with Mobikwik comes amid renewed optimism in India’s crypto industry, following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a longstanding and controversial ban on domestic banks’ dealings with cryptocurrency businesses.Earlier this month, Mobikwik had made its mobile payment gateway open to all domestic crypto exchanges in response to positive developments at the Supreme Court. BuyUcoin has said its partnership with the firm will offer users more accessible, smartphone-based transactions for the buying and selling of crypto assets.Amid the global public health crisis — which has seen India’s 1.4 billion population placed under government-enforced lockdown — the exchange is also donating 15% of exchange fees to a national COVID-19 relief fund for the next three months.International tiesCross-border collaborations involving crypto in India have taken on fresh impetus during what some dub the industry’s current “renaissance.”Earlier this month, major global crypto exchange Binance and Indian platform WazirX — which Binance acquired in November 2019 — announced a fund aimed at fostering blockchain development in the country.Estonia’s regulator, the Financial Intelligence Unit, has previously extended licenses to non-European exchanges, including Chile’s crypto trading platform CryptoMarket in early March."

The firm is backed by established industry names such as Binance Labs, Arrington XRP Capital, Blocktower and FBG Capital.Commenting on the new partnership, Cred CEO Dan Schatt said that the firm was keen to offer its decentralized financial services to customers in these “times of financial instability.”With the integration of Cred’s services, Huobi users will be able to lend their crypto holdings to receive monthly interest payments, with the possibility of rolling over their pledged assets for additional periods of time. There is no minimum requirement to participate in the program, and interest is payable in stablecoins or other crypto assets.Holders with $150,000 in their wallets can also develop a custom program by consulting with Cred’s Private Client Associates.An emerging sectorHuobi and Cred’s partnership has been cemented at a time when cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services are gaining increasing traction across the industry.In January, Celsius Network — the fastest-growing crypto-lender with $4.25 billion in coin loan origination — announced that it would be implementing compounding interest on all cryptocurrencies deposited in its wallet — a feature that had been requested by the Celsius community.Other major players in the crypto lending space include BlockFi, Nexo, YouHolder and SALT Lending."
42323, Not April Fool’s — Trump Hints at $9 Oil After Accidental Bitcoin Plug ,2020-04-01t10:06:00+01:00,62531,207,"After inadvertently advertising Bitcoin (BTC) last week, United States President Donald Trump has now hinted that he expects oil to crash to just $9.In a press conference on March 31, Trump reiterated what has become a penchant for lower oil prices.Trump: $9 could “get you what you wanted”He was speaking amid talks with both Russia and Saudi Arabia, both of which plan to increase oil production this month despite the plunge in demand caused by coronavirus. WTI crude prices have lost more than 50% in the past 30 days alone.“Look, it’s $22, but it’s really much cheaper than that if you want to negotiate — nobody’s seen that,” Trump told the press.“That’s like from the 1950s, it really is — to think that it was $50, $60, $70, $80 — and now it’s $22, but you know, if you put a good bid in at $9, I think you could probably get what you wanted, right?”The last time that oil circled $10 was in 1998 when Saudi Arabia likewise flooded the market to ward off an advance by Venezuela.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has limited its year-to-date losses to around 10%, whereas WTI has shed almost 70%, according to data from monitoring resource Skew.Macro assets returns for 2020. Source: SkewOil producers go for brokeTrump’s comments were particularly poignant coming on the back of the turmoil facing both the U.S. dollar and its issuer, the Federal Reserve.After the Fed said that it had “unlimited” money, Trump claimed that the state could manipulate infinitely, describing it as “our money” and “our currency.”This, in turn, sent shivers down the spine of Bitcoin supporters, as the lack of such meddling in the money supply is a key benefit over fiat which makes the cryptocurrency a form of “hard” money.The planned production boost in April is especially notable for Russia’s fiat currency, the ruble, and those who use it. Heavily tied to oil prices, the ruble has plunged to its lowest level against the dollar in four years.Paradoxically, Russia currently spends money propping up the ruble’s exchange rate while also producing oil for a saturated market."
42322, New Blockchain Project Lets Users Choose Their Renewable Energy Source ,2020-04-01t10:05:20+01:00,2926,108,"Australian blockchain firm Power Ledger and French green energy retailer ekWateur are betting that consumer choice can help spur the transition to sustainable energy usage.In an announcement on April 1, the two firms revealed that they will be offering almost a quarter of a million French residents the opportunity to customize their energy mix, using blockchain technology to securely certify its source.Green choicesThe new partnership will involve connecting ekWakteur’s network of over 220,000 electricity meters across France to a new blockchain-enabled tool from Power Ledger, dubbed Vision. EkWakteur — a green energy retailer and aggregator which supplies 100% renewable electricity generated from wind turbines, photovoltaic panels and hydraulic plans — is reportedly the first company in France to provide 100% renewable gas from biomethane. Using Power Ledger’s blockchain tool, households will be able to select their preferred energy mix and track it in 30-minute intervals, relying on the Vision platform to certify the origin and source of their chosen supply. Power Ledger’s executive chairman Dr. Jemma Green said:“Whether consumers want to source energy from their neighbour’s solar rooftop panels, or a wind farm in Bordeaux, our platform gives consumers choice and control over their energy source.” Both firms underscore the role that expanding consumer choice and flexibility can play in meeting the targets set at the Paris Climate Accords, which aim at a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Each household needs to be empowered to make the switch to green energy, Dr. Green argued.The technology is set to go live across ekWakteur’s network by the year’s end, with Dr. Green claiming that the nationwide roll-out represents “a world-first in energy trading” by giving customers expanded control and security. It is also the company’s largest project to date.Blockchain for decentralized renewables tradingAt the start of this year, researchers at Ireland’s Economic and Social Research Institute proposed that blockchain can provide the infrastructure to innovate renewable energy management. They proposed tools that would support the forward selling of renewable electricity generation and tokenized interaction between energy providers and consumers.Power Ledger has developed a blockchain-enabled renewable energy trading platform and a series of associated tools that support energy trading, renewable asset financing and more efficient carbon and renewable energy credit markets.In September 2019, the firm launched its first trial of peer-to-peer energy trading technology in rural areas of Australia, designed to help commercial settlements and farms improve the efficiency of their power grid and reduce associated costs.In November, Power Ledger realized the first commercial roll-out of its blockchain-based energy trading application, which enables users to pool their excess solar and battery storage to a Virtual Power Plant for greater control and management over their consumption."
42319, Bitcoin and Visa Transactions Plunge But Pizza Deliveries Are Up ,2020-04-01t08:22:00+01:00,2858,105,"Online purchases using Bitcoin (BTC), Visa, and some retail apps are down for the first quarter of 2020, spanning cryptocurrency and fiat currency transactions.With many around the world self-quarantining or otherwise recommended to stay inside to prevent the spread of COVID-19, one might assume there would be an increase in online purchases and deliveries. Yet with unemployment on the rise and an uncertain economic future, it seems consumers want to save their money rather than spend it.Bitcoin transactions rivaling those during crypto winterThe crypto market is not exempt from this dearth of purchases.The number of daily transactions of BTC has fallen by roughly 100,000 since the beginning of March. The last time the number of transactions of the cryptocurrency was this low was during the ""crypto winter,"" after the price of BTC dropped to around $3,000 in December 2018.Shortly before the spread of COVID-19 to many countries, on Feb. 5 the Bitcoin network celebrated passing half a billion total transactions since the first went through on Jan. 12, 2009. While these numbers indicated a more mainstream acceptance of crypto for everyday purchases, the recent drop is a significant setback to this goal.Market analyst Mati Greenspan noted that “people are simply more hesitant to spend their Bitcoins at this time.”Visa reports a sharp drop at the end of MarchAccording to Reuters, Visa is predicting only single-digit percentage revenue growth — in contrast to the Q1 2019 double-digit growth — for Q2 after a sharp drop in activity during March.Reuters says that measures like sheltering in place or lockdowns may be partially responsible, by preventing consumers from swiping their Visa cards in person at restaurants, entertainment venues and everything else they do outside their homes. However, there is also a lack of online spending including for larger travel-related services like flights.Payment apps are not being used as oftenSquare, the company behind the Cash App — which supports cryptocurrency — is expected to report “lower-than-expected revenue and earnings” after claiming a 25% reduction in seller Gross Payment Volume on March 25. The company is withdrawing its 2020 estimates and will provide new ones in May as a result.On a semi-positive note, at least the number of pizza deliveries is on the rise. American pizza chain Papa John's said that same-store sales rose by over 5% in the first quarter of this year, as people in quarantine rely on delivery options for food."
42318, How to Trade Bitcoin Using Leverage and Not Worry About Liquidation ,2020-04-01t07:40:00+01:00,6969,138,"Institutional traders have long known the benefits of derivatives trading, including leverage and hedging. By trading options markets, one can predetermine maximum gains and losses, even with volatile assets like Bitcoin (BTC).Despite being far more complex, such instruments allow traders to generate gains independent of what happens over the next weeks or even months, which is essential for traders’ peace of mind to achieve optimal performance.Retail traders have only recently begun using derivatives, although they have focused almost exclusively on futures contracts offered by BitMEX, OKEx, Binance and so many others. The main problem here is liquidation risk, as cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile.Buying a call option? Here are the costs and benefitsThe buyer of a call option can acquire Bitcoin for a fixed price on a predetermined date. For that privilege, the buyer pays an upfront premium for the call option seller. Contracts have a set maturity date and strike price so that everyone knows potential gains and losses beforehand.If Bitcoin appreciates over the following hours or days, the price paid for this call option should increase. The buyer could either sell this option contract and close his position with a profit or wait until contract expiry.At the specified contract date and time of maturity, the call option buyer will be able to acquire Bitcoin for the previously agreed price. Remember, the buyer paid a premium in advance for this right. If Bitcoin’s price is currently below the contract price, the buyer can walk away. That’s why it’s called an “option” in the first place.Each exchange sets its minimum trade size, although a 0.1 Bitcoin contract tends to be the lowest figure.Benefits of Bitcoin options compared to futures contractsThe main benefit to the buyer of an option is that they know in advance the maximum loss and also do not have to worry about having their position closed in advance.Let’s imagine a scenario in which an investor has $500 and expects the price of Bitcoin to increase substantially over the next month. By using futures contracts, it is possible to leverage their position, boosting gains by 20 times or even 50 times.It should also be said that there is one risk with this strategy. What happens if over the following days the market suddenly drops 2% or 5%, an occurrence quite frequent with Bitcoin. If this happens the position will get liquidated or forcibly terminated. Meaning, even if markets recover shortly thereafter, there is no second chance for the option holder.BTC call option buyer returnsTheoretical return for a call option buyerThe example above shows that the call option buyer paid a $450 premium upfront for the option to acquire a Bitcoin at a fixed price of $7,500 on April 24. The buyer has a limited downside of $450, while their upside is unlimited.The premium paid upfront for a call option depends on:Current Bitcoin price: If Bitcoin is trading at $5,000 and the expiry takes place in 10 days, a call option with a $9,000 strike price will most likely cost less than $40. On the other hand, a $4,000 strike should set the buyer back $1,100 or more.Days until maturity: The higher the number of days until maturity, the higher the price of a call option will be. Assuming both have the same strike price, the one with the farthest expiry will tend to cost much more.Recent volatility: If the price hasn’t oscillated very much over the past 30 or 60 days, odds for a substantial price increase are low. Low volatility causes call option prices to be lower when compared to a high volatility scenario.Interest rate: A high-interest rate would result in excessive premiums of options. Fortunately, that hasn’t been the case, as the cost of borrowing money is currently close to zero.Call option prices screenshot on March 26. Source: DeribitBecause Bitcoin traded at $6,730 on March 26, one should expect a $6,000 strike for a call option to cost $800 or higher. On the other hand, an $11,000 strike price in just 28 days seems quite unlikely to happen, hence its $90 price.It might seem unreasonable to sell a call option with unlimited downside in exchange for a fixed upfront. Except, that is not the case if the investor already owns Bitcoin. Under this new perspective, the call option seller is potentially getting paid more than making a regular sale.Buying a protective put optionA put option grants its buyer the opportunity to sell Bitcoin at a previously agreed-upon price on a future date. Once again, the buyer pays an upfront premium for this privilege. Instead of using a stop-loss order on a regular exchange, a holder can reduce their losses from a price drop using options contracts.With Bitcoin currently trading near $6,730 levels, a $6,000 put option contract expiring in 27 days costs $440. If Bitcoin drops to $5,000, this investor would then be able to make a sale for the predetermined price of $6,000, resulting in a net loss of only $170.Investors tend to consider this strategy as insurance. If the price of Bitcoin does not drop below the $6,000 strike price, the investor paid a 6.5% premium for nothing. Their upside, on the other hand, has been reduced by $440, although it remains unlimited.Options provide a nearly endless limit of investment strategiesThe fact that a call option buyer has an unlimited upside — and unlike futures contracts, can’t be forcibly liquidated during the trade — should be an excellent incentive that encourages retail traders to use it more often.In addition to the basic methods described above, there’s much more to options trading, including strategies that combine different strikes and maturities. Institutional traders have long been taking advantage of those instruments and this allows them to take time off-screen and prepare for different investment scenarios by hedging their positions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42317, Australian Uni Partners With Ripple on Blockchain Law Courses ,2020-04-01t05:51:00+01:00,4671,155,"The Australian National University (ANU)’s law school will roll out two new courses in its Masters program next year exploring the impact of blockchain on the legal field.The courses are being developed with the assistance of Ripple’s Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) — a program that seeks to collaborate with universities to examine emerging trends and developments in distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency and digital payments.ANU already offers undergraduate courses examining the intersection between blockchain and law, as do a number of other Australian universities. The University of Melbourne and The University of Southern Queensland offer courses explicitly concerned with DLT and blockchain, while other institutions incorporate the subject into broader programs.ANU law school partners with Ripple to launch courses studying blockchainScott Chamberlain, entrepreneurial fellow at the ANU School of Law, will develop and run the university’s blockchain units. The courses will examine whether blockchain and smart contracts can be used to automate and decentralize legal processes and dispute resolution.He is passionate about its potential: “Imagine an eBay-like platform that can resolve consumer law disputes without engaging the court system,” he said.Chamberlain said that many simple legal processes — such as confirming the identities and relationship of the relevant parties, and the rules governing their interactions — could utilise blockchain.“[A legal dispute] deals with who are the legal identities that the law recognizes? What are the legal things that the law recognizes existing? What’s the relationship between people and things? And there’s a dispute resolution at the heart of it. When you look at the blockchain smart contract space, there’s projects doing all of those things.""Chamberlain operates the ‘Lex Automagica’ platform at ANU, which is an attempt to solve some of these issues without engaging the middlemen and gatekeepers of the legal industry. In February 2019, Ripple provided Lex Automatica with $1 million in funding.Legal academics and practitioners are becoming increasingly interested in the potential of blockchain to provide decentralized dispute resolution. Projects already up and running include Jur, Kleros, and Aragon Court."
42316, Japanese Regulations on Crypto ‘Likely to Help the Market to Mature’ ,2020-04-01t05:20:00+01:00,2002,88,"A new report has found strict regulations in Japan are likely to benefit new players in the long term.Double jump.tokyo, the game developer behind My Crypto Heroes, introduced So & Sato, a Japan-based law firm specializing in crypto and blockchain, to Cointelegraph Japan.On March 31, the law firm released a report covering all aspects of digital assets in the Asian nation, from tokenized securities to crypto derivatives.Entering the crypto market under strict regulationsJoerg Schmidt and So Saito from So & Sato told Cointelegraph Japan in an interview that local regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges are “far stricter” than in most other countries. However, they said this would be beneficial in the long run because it encourages the traditional finance world to get involved:“The market is highly regulated in Japan. What seems to be a regulatory overkill, at first sight, is likely to help the market to mature in the mid to long term. This will allow more institutional players to enter the market and to increase their stake in the digital asset space.”Regulations pertaining to crypto in Japan generally fall under the Payment Services Act (PSA) and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). Amendments passed for both acts tightening existing regulations enter into force in May.Under the new PSA regulations, crypto exchanges must employ third-party operators to keep hold of their users’ money, separating it from their own cash flow.Foreign-operated crypto exchanges in JapanUnder local law, cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan must obtain a license through the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), while foreign-based exchanges must hold a license both in their home jurisdiction and in Japan. The report details the requirements:“To register as a crypto asset exchange [in Japan], companies must meet certain criteria. Local companies must be incorporated as a stock company and have a minimum capital of JPY 10 million. An exchange must further ensure that its net assets do not fall below the amount of users’ funds that are stored in a hot wallet.”As of today, there are 23 exchanges registered with the FSA, although none of them are yet foreign operated. OKCoin, which operates a subsidiary in Japan, was recently granted a license. So explains why the regulations seem to discourage overseas exchanges:“Some Chinese exchanges have purchased an already-licensed Japanese exchange, so it’s open for foreign exchanges to take over licensed entities in Japan. But under the regulations, if foreign crypto exchanges themselves want to obtain Japanese licenses, they need to have similar licenses in their countries under the current regulations. There are not so many similar exchanges in foreign countries.”The law firm concluded that the most likely exchanges that could be granted licenses would come from countries such as the United States, where regulations are thorough.Getting in on the Japanese crypto market earlyWhile local regulations might not be conducive to foreign exchanges at the moment, the law firm alluded that it was not a bad time to enter the crypto market in Japan.They believe the regulatory measures help make Japan stand out as a safe haven for crypto, rather than the wild west of finance that it’s sometimes known for."
42314, Economist Jeffrey Tucker: ‘Can You Imagine BTC Price if it Had Scaled?’ ,2020-04-01t04:11:00+01:00,7619,125,"American Institute for Economic Research editorial director Jeffrey Tucker reignited the long-running Bitcoin scaling debate with a tweet earlier today.The economist — who has long been a proponent of Bitcoin (BTC) — suggested the current price is much lower than it otherwise would have been because the underlying technology has not been “properly scaled”.On March 31, Tucker tweeted:I'm not unimpressed by a $6K price of BTC. I was blown away when the thing reached $30.00. But can you imagine the price today if the thing had properly scaled?— Jeffrey A Tucker (@jeffreyatucker) March 30, 2020The Tweet expands on comments Tucker made earlier this month on RT, during a panel discussion with noted Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff. During the debate he said too much time had been wasted on this “ridiculous scaling problem” which had ultimately prevented mainstream adoption:“Adoption hasn’t gone far enough and it hasn’t come into consumer use like it should and would have if it had been able to scale. Now we’re seeing what happens when Bitcoin was not properly scaled.”Tucker said Bitcoin was designed to thrive in times like the current financial crisis, and suggested the reason it hasn’t is due to its scaling problem:“Bitcoin was innovated to become a safe haven during times just like this. So why aren’t we seeing Bitcoin become the safe haven that it was developed to be, and was for a number of years?”Vitalik Buterin and Blockstream weigh inThe BTC scaling issue has been one of the most heated debates in cryptocurrency. The base layer network isn’t able to process transactions quickly enough to enable wide scale, mainstream adoption as a currency. The debate over raising the block size as a solution ultimately led to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) forks, while Bitcoin itself adopted the layer two Lightning Network as a scaling solution.Tucker’s March 31 tweet sparked a debate among prominent members of Crypto Twitter. Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin encouraged the economist to look at the long awaited Ethereum 2.0, which is due to launch this year, stating it will have “high scalability but without the centralization that rely solely on increasing block size.”This provoked much derision from Bitcoin development company Blockstream’s CEO Adam Back, and CSO Samson Mow, who wrote “Lols” and posted a ‘crying with laughter’ emoji respectively.Scaling has nothing to do with the priceOn chain analyst Willy Woo suggested that scaling has nothing to do with the price or market cap, pointing to gold as an example:“Gold is $9T. How many transactions per second does gold do? I mean shipping the underlying between vaults. That's BTC main chain. The swaps we do on ETFs and derivatives is Gold's layer 2. That s--t scales, so will BTC's layer 2.”Bitcoin Advisory founder Pierre Rochard said the price would be the same regardless as scaling is ""not the bottleneck for adoption.""Bitcoin proponent Vijay Boyapati argued it was not necessary to imagine a “properly scaled” Bitcoin, as that was Bitcoin Cash: ""The price would be $200; the price of BCash. i.e., the market massively discounts what you consider ""proper scaling"" and greatly values immutability.""Investor and author Tuur Demeester said Tucker's tweet had annoyed him: ""Having been in Bitcoin as long as you have you should know better imo — Bitcoin is scaling just fine.""To which Tucker laid down a challenge: “Well, let's get off Twitter and discuss this like gentlemen sometime.”"
42310, Proof-of-Stake Vs. Proof-of-Work: Which One Is ‘Fairer’? ,2020-04-01t01:55:00+01:00,3499,148,"This is the first of two articles providing a deeper dive into the eternal debate between the proof-of-stake and proof-of-work consensus algorithms. This part will focus on the basics, while also discussing the issue of wealth concentration and inequality, which is often at the center of any community argument.Bitcoin (BTC) and many of the original cryptocurrencies were born as pure proof-of-work systems.Proof-of-stake was first pioneered in 2013 by Peercoin, a project that exists to this day.Peercoin’s contribution to the popularity of PoS is likely dwarfed by Ethereum (ETH) and its goal to transition from PoW —which has turned out to be a very long journey. Projects such as Cardano (ADA) avoided PoW entirely, deciding on PoS after using a formal approach to assess consensus mechanisms.The Bitcoin and Monero (XMR) communities remain some of the staunchest proponents of mining and proof-of-work.What is a consensus algorithm?In any blockchain, the consensus algorithm is designed to solve the issue of trust between the participants of a network. Used for payments, the consensus algorithm is the final piece in the complex cryptographic puzzle that makes cryptocurrency work.Basic features of a transaction, such as ownership and amount, are easy to verify with the help of public-key cryptography, which works through fundamental mathematical properties.Consensus algorithms exist to mitigate the “double-spend” attack, where a malicious actor is able to spend the same coin twice (or any number of times). Solving this issue requires a deliberate decision on which of the two spends is valid.There are no pure-mathematical solutions to this problem. Instead, consensus algorithms use a combination of cryptography and economic incentives to maintain a functional network.Bitcoin’s consensus is based on a simple rule — the longest chain of blocks is the only valid one. The system was later termed Nakamoto Consensus, in honor of Bitcoin’s anonymous founder.In order to make the concept work, adding blocks to each chain must be relatively difficult. This is where proof-of-work and mining come in. Each block is secured through cryptographic techniques that require miners to commit computing power in order to add blocks.As computing power is directly proportional to electricity usage, Bitcoin is secured directly by a fundamental physical quantity — energy.Under proof-of-stake, the network secures itself through the commitment of a stake — a certain amount of capital in the form of the network’s own tokens. Its security is meant to be derived directly from the perceived economic value of the network — how expensive it is to purchase a majority stake.But PoW networks also have a close correlation between economic value and security. Miners receive coins as a reward, which means that the higher the value of the coin, the more money they make.New miners are incentivized to add more hardware and spend more energy to receive their share of the rewards — which increases security. Over time, the profit for each individual miner trends toward an economic equilibrium dictated by electricity prices.As a consequence, the amount of electricity dedicated to mining depends on the coin’s emission rate and market capitalization, while it is largely decoupled from the network’s performance or activity. Many PoS proponents see this as the biggest issue of PoW.The energy problemCointelegraph spoke with Aggelos Kiayias, the chief scientist of IOHK, one of the entities behind Cardano, to learn more about their decision to use PoS. She said:“The costs and energy consumption aspects of Proof of Work blockchains were definitely a consideration. It seemed natural to think: ‘is it possible to get a protocol that has a similar type of profile with, for example, Bitcoin’s blockchain, but somehow doesn't have the same energy expenditure?’”The electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining is significant, with the latest estimate from July 2019 placing it at an annualized value of 70 terawatt-hours. This is close to the total electricity use of a small European country like Austria — although to put that in perspective, it is also just 0.28% of the global figure.The environmental impact is contested, with a July 2019 report estimating that 74% of Bitcoin mining is done through renewable sources. Proponents of PoW in Monero and Bitcoin often argue that the energy used in mining is not ""wasted,"" as it is necessary to ensure the resilience and decentralization of the consensus algorithm.Jake Yocom-Piatt, project lead for Decred, agrees with the environmental concerns but doesn't believe that PoS is necessarily the answer. Speaking with Cointelegraph, he said:“PoW is indeed environmentally unfriendly. However, it must be considered that it is the first and simplest consensus system proposed. There are surely ways to improve PoW in the future.”Though proof-of-stake also involves energy consumption for the delegation process, it is generally agreed to be far less energy-intensive than an equivalent proof-of-work solution. However, many argue that it compromises on too many things in order to achieve this.Trusting PoS historyAccording to Yocom-Piatt, pure PoS is reversible, which means that its history can be changed. This is similar to an argument made in a 2015 paper by Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Bitcoin development company Blockstream.Poelstra argued that it is impossible for a user to rely on the proofs-of-stake to claim that a particular block is valid — because that stake itself depends on previous stakes within that blockchain, which are ultimately based on nothing. He wrote:“Because there is no universal time (and to new users, no universal history), there is no way to differentiate users who are ‘now’ holding the currency from users who ‘were’ holding the currency.”PoW history, by contrast, can be mathematically verified to be correct and can only be counterfeited by recreating its entire mining history. As noted by Poelstra, PoS proponents will argue that as long as short-term history can be secured, changes in old blocks will “contradict the history as remembered by participants of the system.”This, according to him, “changes the trust model from that of Bitcoin” to one where consensus relies on always-online peers. While he believes that this could theoretically work, he argues that such a trust model is “vulnerable to legal pressure, attacks on ‘trusted’ entities and network attacks” — that it’s less censorship-resistant and decentralized, in short.PoS proponents agree that a certain aspect of extra-protocol social coordination and consensus is necessary to maintain its security, but they argue that PoW systems ultimately rely on social consensus as well.There is no clear winner in this line of argument. It is a philosophical debate that hinges on each individual’s opinion about whether actively relying on social consensus is an acceptable compromise to reduce electricity usage. It is perhaps for this reason that the debate has since moved into other contentious topics.Acquiring stake vs. acquiring workEconomic fairness is an often debated point for both types of consensus. In line with the principle of decentralization, both sides seek to minimize issues such as unfair access to the ecosystem or increasing wealth disparity.Proof-of-stake is often considered to be a system where “the rich get richer” due to the way it rewards the ownership of capital. In a Reddit AMA, Ethereum Foundation representatives argued that the opposite is true:“In both bases, the owning of an asset allows for seeking gains on that asset. The difference between the two is that in PoS, the mapping of capital to gains is much more direct and fair (i.e. buy token, lock token, perform duties, gain X). Where in PoW, the mapping of capital to gains is highly dependent upon extra-protocol factors.”In the Cardano network, Kiayias emphasized that PoS makes no distinction between the “rich man’s dollar” and the “poor man’s dollar.” He explained:“Proof of Work systems, if you look at them, cannot give you a perfectly egalitarian version [of consensus] [...] Whereas in a Proof of Stake system, in principle, you could have a situation where one dollar in the pocket of the poor person would be equal in strength to a dollar in the pocket of a rich person.”The CEO of Equilibrium, a project designing an algorithmic stablecoin on EOS, also agreed with the Ethereum Foundation’s argument:“I totally support this assessment. Staking highly fungible tokens doesn't create any entry barriers and doesn't lead to any kind of disparity as long as the given tokens are accessible on the open market.”They share the opinion that mining increases wealth disparity due to the accumulation of “extra-protocol” factors. Bulk discounts, early or even exclusive access to new hardware — all of these make proof-of-work inherently unfair, according to many PoS proponents.Alejandro De La Torre, VP at Poolin, currently the largest Bitcoin mining pool, believes the exact opposite — that extra-protocol advantages make proof-of-work fair. Speaking with Cointelegraph, he said:“In my opinion, the possibility of creating a new chip, accelerating the OS of a mining rig, or literally any other discovery that gives you an advantage in PoW mining is essentially the reason why PoW is the fairer 'cryptoeconomic' protocol. [...] PoS only relies on having the core asset; and the more you have the more you make. There is no other way to improve your situation in PoS mining, barring of course just purchasing more of the underlying staked asset.”Equality of opportunity is what mattersCointelegraph also spoke with Campbell R. Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University, to learn more about the concept of economic disparity and how it relates to consensus mechanisms. Summarizing his position on the wealth disparity gap in blockchain economics, he said:“Yes, one critique of PoS is that the rich get richer. In PoW, it is more of a business operation with the miners not needing to hold BTC, ETH, etc. In PoS, you need to hold.”Harvey argues that the two systems have different economic natures, focusing on the business operation aspect of PoW — where miners can have negative profit, get outcompeted or fail entirely. He explained:“I don’t think modern mining is an important factor for wealth distribution. Indeed, a large amount of mining becomes obsolete not because of age but because of fluctuations in BTC prices.”When asked whether bulk discounts contribute toward wealth disparity, he replied that it is a normal economic phenomenon called scale efficiency. Mining is “no different than any other industry” according to him.Harvey then explained that wealth inequality is generally expected in any free market system due to “differential natural endowment of skill” and luck. He continued:“We usually focus on inequality of opportunity rather than wealth. In a free market, anyone with a good idea should be able to make it to the top 1%.”From an opportunity standpoint, proof-of-stake systems are generally fair. Harvey pointed to the model of delegated proof-of-stakeas an example, where “even small holders can participate in the miner rewards by delegating some of their stake.”Staking pools and delegation models are generally present in any PoS system though, and they could be implemented through extra-protocol measures as well — similar to PoW mining pools.But De La Torre argues that equality of opportunity applies to the ASIC mining industry as well. He explained:“Historically, machines last a good three or four years before they are made obsolete — break, difficulty too high, etc. [...] Like we are seeing now, with the ending of the mighty [Bitmain] S9 era, the entire cycle of the mining industry begins again. This cycle is the creation of new miners, new OS [operating systems], the sourcing of cheaper electricity around the globe. This cycle also brings in new participants that want to take advantage of PoW mining.”Mining is not always the sameKristy Leigh-Minehan, former chief technology officerof Genesis Mining and one of the creators of ProgPow, believes that many of the equality concerns against PoW are specifically related to ASIC mining. When using consumer hardware to mine, their wide availability diminishes many of the supposedly unfair competitive practices. She explained:“CPUs and GPUs have existing supply chains that are used to distribute to hundreds of thousands of individuals, every day, all over the world. So when you build a Proof of Work algorithm that takes advantage of that hardware, you're piggybacking on that supply chain and that distribution channel, instead of creating and inventing your own.”In her view, ensuring that “Alice and Bob have the same capability of earning a coin” is crucial in designing a proper PoW algorithm. She conceded that miners will always tend to specialize and optimize their operations, so the key is to ensure that miners compete fairly “on the CapEx side.”Capital expenditure, or CapEx,for ASICs can be reduced significantly for large players due to scale effects. On the other hand, GPUs and other consumer hardware are much cheaper and easier to source for average people, according to Minehan.The fundamental contribution of PoWMinehan is a strong believer in the contribution to network activity from GPU miners — especially early on. She emphasized that “humans don't want to spend their hard-earned fiat on magical internet money.”On the other hand, she believes contributing with already-owned computer power is a much more suitable proposition.In truth, the concept of an initial coin offering is, essentially, spending fiat on “magical internet money.” But this could not have happened by itself — it is the result of the groundwork laid by Bitcoin and Ethereum.The former legitimized the entire concept of “magical internet money.” More than 17 months passed between the Bitcoingenesis block in January 2009 and the famous Bitcoin pizza transaction on May 22, 2010 — the first to give BTC a fiat value.Ethereum built on this by being one of the first ICOs in 2013, and proving that the concept can work.Distributing the initial Bitcoinwould have been essentially impossible in a staking environment. It is only after the network is stabilized, Minehan argues, that the transition to staking can occur.Yocom-Piatt also highlighted PoW as a “high quality source of entropy” to ensure a fair distribution of tokens. Peercoin also relied on PoW for the initial distribution.The systems are different, not necessarily better or worseIn conclusion, debates on the economic equality of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work are perhaps the wrong way to look about it, as Harvey suggested. It is difficult to conclude that one system centralizes wealth more than the other.In most PoW systems, the miners can gain unfair advantages over others — but they can also fail and lose their entire investment through no fault of their own, something that is normally impossible in PoS systems.Yocom-Piatt, whose project is a hybrid, summarized that “pure PoS is substantially different from pure PoW.”He argues that hybridizing them allows Decred to benefit from the best of both worlds. The PoW side “works well as a means to gamify timestamping” and thus ensure immutability, but PoS is still needed to align incentives for governance.Yocom-Piatt believes that miners’ interests are not as strongly aligned with the cryptocurrency as for stakers, which leads to “shortcomings in the context of governance.”Decred’s experience may suggest it is misguided to debate PoS in opposition to PoW. Combining both appears to shore up any perceived weaknesses that they may have individually — something that is not applicable to other blockchain debates, such as Ethash versus ProgPow.But from a governance standpoint, the recent exchange takeover of Steem highlighted that those who control tokens are necessarily the owners of those tokens.The second part of this series will feature an in-depth examination of how governance works in PoS and PoW."
42305, Australian Startup Offers New Spin on Tokenized Gold Trading ,2020-04-01t00:34:00+01:00,2942,195,"Australian startup Meld Gold will launch a blockchain-based platform for tokenized gold trading in the third quarter of 2020.Meld Gold said the platform will offer a digital method to buy and sell physical gold that is more efficient and transparent than traditional gold markets.Unlike other gold-backed tokens, the issuer doesn’t have a stash of gold in its own custody — rather each token represents one gram of gold held across different companies in the network, including the Melbourne Mint.Meld Gold to launch platform on AlgorandThe original prototype platform was built on Ethereum (ETH) in mid-2019, but the final version is being built in partnership with Algorand (ALGO). It’s due to launch in July or August.AJ Milne, Meld Gold’s general manager, told Cointelegraph that it has already inked partnerships with “multiple businesses in the gold supply chain that will start “utilizing the platform immediately upon launch.”Meld tokens backed by gold held across the supply chainMilne explained that each token would be backed by one gram of gold, but, “as a decentralized industry token, gold will be held across the supply chain.”“Independent vaults will still hold gold, as will refineries as they receive gold. At each of these points in the supply chain, gold tokens can be minted and recorded. No single entity will hold all of the gold (no central point of failure).”There will be no fixed supply for the token, with the minting and burning of tokens set to be “dictated by market demand and supply from a combination of the traditional gold market and the digital market.” Meld will act as a market maker in the system, and there are no transaction or storage fees incurred by using the platform.AJ emphasizes that gold held within the system will be independently audited, adding that “strong penalties” will be “imposed on bad actors.” All entities interested in joining the network would undergo a vetting process.Peter August, the CEO bullion dealer Melbourne Mint, said:“Many companies have tried to create their own version of gold-backed tokens, but what Meld is doing is new: they’re using blockchain technology to not just emulate but improve the actual gold market.”Meld plans international expansionAfter launching the platform, Milne states that Meld will spend the rest of 2020 working on its wallet application and expanding its local partner network.In 2021, the company hopes to establish partnerships in North America, Asia, and Europe."

The data was reportedly exposed on distributed search engine Elasticsearch for about 11 days until it was removed after Diachenko filed an abuse report.Diachenko elaborated to Cointelegraph that the number of leaked records purportedly corresponds to the number of “Telegram” users affected. He said:“42 million is the number of the records in the database which, we assume, are unique and correspond to the affected persons number.”The reported data breach definitely poses significant risks like SIM swapping and phishing attacks as well as other scams using the phone numbers in the database. Moreover, the leakage reveals data of as many as 42 million Iranian people who were trying to still use Telegram despite the application being banned in the country since 2018.Telegram blames Iranian people for using unofficial Telegram apps despite multiple warningsThe exposure wouldn’t have been possible without people using unofficial versions Telegram messenger, a Telegram spokesperson reportedly told Comparitech. Telegram emphasized that the leaked data came from unofficial Telegram applications or so-called “forks” of Telegram that are not affiliated with the official company. This became possible because Telegram is an open-source application that allows third parties to create their own versions of it.Telegram reportedly said:“We can confirm that the data seems to have originated from third-party forks extracting user contacts. Unfortunately, despite our warnings, people in Iran are still using unverified apps. Telegram apps are open source, so it’s important to use our official apps that support verifiable builds.”As reported by local publications, Iranians created a number of “fork” Telegram apps like Telegram Talaeii and Hotgram in response to the messenger’s ban in the country. According to estimations, Talaeii and Hotgram amassed about 30 million users as of December 2018. According to BBC, real Telegram messenger was estimated to have about 50 million users in Iran as of 2018 before it was banned in the country.While the latest data breach doesn’t involve the official Telegram company directly, the actual messenger suffered a major hack in Iran back in 2016. According to reports, Iranian hackers were able to compromise more than a dozen accounts to identify phone numbers of 15 million Telegram users in Iran despite the messenger’s focus on user privacy and security.In mid-March 2020, Cointelegraph reported on Chinese social media giant Weibo experiencing a massive data breach that reportedly led to 172 million users having their account information leaked."

State governments and hospitals sat on the purchasing side, while mask brokers looked to secure deals on the seller side.“The high price point per mask, driven by extreme demand, has contributed to an overwhelmed reaction among potential buyers, especially in the U.S.,” DiSalvo said.After multiple hours of antics, all the masks up for grabs left the country, bought up by international parties instead of the interested U.S.-based entities.DiSalvo described a mass, single-day exodus of masks. “By the end of the day, roughly 280 million masks from warehouses around the U.S. had been purchased by foreign buyers and were earmarked to leave the country,” DiSalvo said, according to information from medical supply broker Remington Schmidt.“This is the craziest market I’ve ever seen,” Schmidt told DiSalvo. “If you are working with a seller who has masks but you can’t quickly show proof of funds, someone else is going to buy them,” he said.Crypto markets often see similar conditionsOften compared to the Wild West, the crypto space often exudes many of these conditions at varying points.Few scenarios include the hype and demand seen in the crypto space during 2017, when projects touting little more than a paper-based idea raised millions of dollars in seconds via ICOs. Most of these projects turned out to be scams.Crypto is also a largely borderless market, drawing attention from all across the globe. Masks have similarly become an international concern.As crypto, and now the N95 mask market, has shown — hype, supply and demand all hold the potential to drastically change markets. Over the last two years, many of those exuberant ICOs have fallen drastically in price, showing little current demand amid various lawsuits."

42278, New Lightning Network Authentication Method Could Replace Website Accounts ,2020-03-31t18:36:00+01:00,1960,82,"Blockchain firm Lightning Labs drafted the specifications of a new Lightning Network-based authentication system that could replace traditional email-based accounts.According to a March 30 announcement, the Lightning Service Authentication Tokens (LSAT) is a new authentication protocol for paid services. The system issues Lightning-based tokens for users after they paid for the service in Bitcoin (BTC) instead of providing their personal information for traditional email-based accounts.The lightning tokens in question act as tickets for the purchased resources and encode what resource it grants access to. The tokens can be exchanged, revoked and modified after being issued. LSAT also reportedly allows for applications that charge users on an ongoing basis for resources instead of periodic upfront payments.The forgotten status codeLSAT leverages the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) status code 402, meant to warn the user’s web browser that payment is required to access the service. While developers are familiar with status codes like 404, which is sent when a client is requesting a resource that is not found on the server, has seen little use. According to Mozilla, it has no standard use convention. The announcement explains:“As the name entails, this code is returned when a client attempts to access a resource that they haven't paid for yet. In most versions of the HTTP specification, this code is marked as being ‘reserved for future use.’ Many speculate that it was intended to be used by some sort of digital cash or micropayment scheme, which didn't yet exist at the time of the initial HTTP specification drafting.”As Lightning Labs points out, now digital cash does exist in the form of Bitcoin, so the status code can be used as intended. The implementation of such a system could create a seamless way to pay for and immediately access web services without needing accounts. The announcement describes how a web with such an integration would work:“In this new web, email addresses and passwords are a thing of the past. Instead cryptographic bearer credentials are purchased and presented by users to access services and resources. In this new web, credit cards no longer serve as a gatekeeper to all the amazing experiences that have been created on the web.”The promises of web 3.0Many in the blockchain industry advocate for web 3.0 technology as it is believed as a way to make the internet more democratic, open and private. Furthermore, a November 2019 Cointelegraph analysis also suggests that web 3.0 developments can also drive cryptocurrency adoption to new heights.Earlier this month, the Web3 foundation issued a grant to interoperability project Interlay for bringing Bitcoin on the Polkadot platform."

But you tweeted: ”Still worried about #BTC going to 0? Don’t! So long as I have a penny left, it won't happen.” What three words would you use to describe 2020?Changpeng Zhao: It’s hard to define the year 2020 with three words. If I must pick three words, I would say: challenge, opportunity and decentralization. The year ahead will be a mix of challenges and opportunities as the industry takes one step further toward the future of decentralization.The global outbreak of coronavirus does affect certain industries and has caused many countries to lock down. Industries like traveling, tourism and hotels are greatly affected in the short term. However, it also creates opportunities for industries like medicine, health care, online education, etc. Among market activities, great attention has been given to the circuit breaker incidents of the United States stock market. As part of the global financial market, the crypto market has also been volatile for the past couple of days.There are a lot of people asking if Bitcoin is a safe haven, and we see a lot of confusion around the topic. When we talk about safe havens or the storage of value of a certain asset, we should take the context into consideration. There are a lot of factors affecting the value of an asset, and it also varies during different times. We cannot say an asset is always a safe haven. Bitcoin’s price drop is not the result of a single factor. We need to consider the overall crypto market and even the macro economic conditions. There are different dynamics in play.In the crypto market, we do have diehard OGs who don’t even hold fiat, intermediary users who have 20%–80% of their wealth in crypto and newcomers who have less than 20% — or even 1% — of their wealth in crypto. Different users will make different decisions. The beginners who have entered the space less than five months ago tend to sell crypto in fear, uncertainty or doubt because they don’t have confidence or a deep understanding of crypto.Some people do need money to sustain life, like paying rent in the context of a global financial turmoil. They also decide to sell off. As a result, the price has been brought down. Even if the diehard OGs hold crypto and hold the price up to some level, there are still too many people impacting the market.Compared to the overall financial market, the market capitalization of the crypto market is much smaller, maybe around 1/1000 of that of the overall financial market. It’s inevitable that the crypto market will be affected by activities in the global financial market. When the financial market has lost trillions of dollars, it will affect the crypto market. If fiat crashes, the crypto market cannot solve the issue. But as far as Bitcoin is concerned, it has limited supply, which stays unchangeable in any scenario. So, I would say Bitcoin is a relatively safe haven.But if we look at this from the other way, we will find it’s a good opportunity to weed out the low-quality projects and keep growing the good ones. There isn’t a shortcut for any industry to prosper. We have had good news from the past two weeks. The Supreme Court of India overturned the Reserve Bank of India's ban on banks dealing with crypto businesses. Shortly after that, Korea legalized cryptocurrencies. A lot of regulatory works in various countries are in progress. I believe all of these will positively impact the industry.“What’s more, blockchain is much fairer in solving the fundamental problems of the old system, which means the fiat-based system. It’s unfair to use tax incomes to help inefficient organizations. The inefficient organizations should be left there. If the Federal Reserve prints more money to bring up the stock price, it gives CEOs and institutions a chance to cash out instead of helping the retail users.”A bailout may solve the problems temporarily, but it creates long-term problems. In fact, if the government decides to print more money, it will lead to the depreciation of fiat currencies. Then, if the users have two options — fiat vs. crypto — how will they choose? They will probably opt for Bitcoin and other crypto, which is a great opportunity for the industry to scale.So, to speak of decentralization, we need to see through the surface. Bitcoin is the first application powered by blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies only represent a part of the blockchain. The underlying blockchain technology is what truly matters to us. The other example is the public blockchain teams, who work from different countries and are flexible in the time of uncertainties like the coronavirus pandemic. The Binance team has been working remotely from the very start.CT：You topped our inaugural “Cointelegraph Top 100” list, meaning you’re the most important and influential leader in crypto and blockchain. But, you said in 2019, “I haven’t done so much except building up and leading the excellent Binance team. The real backbreaker is our team.” Can you outline the efforts that the Binance team has undertaken?CZ: Thank you for the nomination. I’m honored to be in the Cointelegraph Top 100. I hope to lead the Binance team to keep up the pace and contribute to the industry, bringing blockchain and crypto to a wider population and boosting adoption toward the mission of driving freedom of money.“The past year can be summarized with the phrase #KeepBuidl. The year 2019 has witnessed many new breakthroughs through the efforts of the team.”In 2019, we launched Binance Chain and Binance DEX. Initially, Binance Chain will focus on token issuance, blockchain financing, etc. So far, there are about 180 tokens issued on Binance Chain. About 100 of them have been listed on Binance DEX, offering more than 120 trading pairs. Binance DEX has been able to overtake its predecessors on the strength of high speed, good depth and high liquidity. The block confirmation time is one second.To introduce more talented developers to Binance Chain, we launched Binance X, a developer-focused initiative to identify the most talented developers, support them through the fellowship program and encourage them to build on Binance Chain.Meanwhile, we have launched margin trading — Binance Futures — fiat gateways that support more than 170 countries. Our fiat-to-crypto solutions include peer-to-peer trading platforms, fiat on-ramps and fiat exchanges that Binance co-founded with local partners, such as Binance.US and Binance Singapore.We even went one step further in that regard. Last year, we launched the Venus project. Binance intends to cooperate with governments, businesses and organizations in the issuance of a series of fiat-backed stablecoins, with the target of offering financial services to people who don’t even have a bank account. In the process, Binance plays the role of tech, risk-control and compliance provider.As part of the project, we’ve issued Binance USD, the stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar, in partnership with Paxos. The stablecoin has been approved by New York Department of Financial Services and is fully compliant. Recently, we issued Binance KRW, the stablecoin backed by the South Korean won, with BXB. There are more projects in progress. Stay tuned.CT: Binance has grown sharply from the initial trading platform built up in 2017 to a whole ecosystem. What is your vision and consideration?CZ: We have introduced multiple trading services, built the Binance ecosystem and launched the Open Platform initiative. By opening the technology and resources of Binance, we endeavor to create more and more fiat–crypto gateways and dramatically reduce the barriers of entry for users.Under the Open Platform initiative, we offer the Binance Broker Program and Binance Cloud program. We launched the Broker Program and announced a big upgrade recently, allowing other exchanges, platforms and institutions to bring trading services to their users through an application programming interface by leveraging Binance’s liquidity and market depth.Binance provides order matching services, account management and settlement systems for brokers so that they can fully focus on business development and receive profit-sharing on trading fees. So far, more than 100 institutions have applied to participate as a Binance Broker, with around 50 already onboarded.The other approach we’re pursuing is the introduction of Binance Cloud. Binance KR, the first digital asset exchange fully powered by Binance Cloud, launched today. Binance Cloud is an infrastructure solution for partners to launch digital asset exchanges by leveraging Binance’s technology, security and liquidity. In five years going forward, Binance Cloud exchanges will overtake Binance.com and contribute the majority of trading volume.In the future, the Open Platform initiative may also encompass the Binance P2P platform and Binance Chain. Binance’s P2P platform serves as an open marketplace, facilitating direct trades between users and merchants. The Binance Chain is a public blockchain initiated by Binance and built through joint efforts of the community. So far, a lot of projects have migrated to Binance Chain. The quality of the projects is pretty high. Hopefully, more projects and developers will build on Binance Chain.CT: In the past you said Blitzscaling, the book by Reid Hoffman, had inspired you a lot. Are there any management strategies for enterprise expansion that you learned from it and used with Binance?CZ: I’m a big fan of Blitzscaling and advise all Binancians to read the book. It’s a great guide book for entrepreneurs. If you look back on how Binance has evolved in less than three years, you might say it’s a typical example of blitzscaling. As a startup, we feel the impetus to launch new products in a fast manner in order to meet the demands of the community.“The Binance team is used to rolling out new products within a tight time frame, outpacing its counterparts by several times. It’s good if there’s a product/market fit. If not, we will pivot quickly and focus resources on products that really matter.”While business development is vital to us, it’s only part of what makes Binance. At Binance, we devote a lot of resources to build and nurture the industry. Together with the community, we spent about a year building the Binance Chain and launched it in April 2019. We also acquired or invested in a few projects and supported the development of transformative projects through Binance Launchpad in an effort to grow the blockchain ecosystem and the crypto industry.CT: While the transformation from a centralized exchange to a decentralized platform is the overall strategy of Binance, the decentralization of Binance DEX once was questioned. How does Binance approach such issues and what are the biggest challenges at this stage?CZ: It’s very interesting to discuss centralization versus decentralization. Firstly, decentralization is where we are heading. But in the short term, centralized and decentralized exchanges will coexist.For those who have a solid technology background and strong sense of security — and who also long for 100% control over their assets — they can opt for decentralized exchanges and wallets. But if you don’t want to manage the assets, prefer to use the custodial services of a trusted provider, and hope to get handy help when you come across a problem, a centralized exchange is there for you.It holds true that the centralized exchanges are the main targets of cybercrimes, especially the major crypto exchanges that hold a great number of digital assets. Cyberattacks are getting more sophisticated and organized. So, a centralized exchange must continue to enhance its tech infrastructure and iterate its security system to provide better protection to users.With increasing demands, both centralized and decentralized exchanges have come along with some issues. To take Binance DEX for example, even though it has become the top decentralized exchange in a very short time, it still has much room for improvement in terms of depth and liquidity.CT: If you could travel back in time, where would you like to go?CZ: If there’s a time machine, I think I will go to the future and see how blockchain has impacted humankind, and how crypto is as widely accepted as fiat is today and has refined the way of transferring value.In the future, people will have better knowledge of the origin, setbacks and developments of blockchain and will use blockchain technology in every aspect of their lives. We don’t have to say how much we believe in crypto, we act on it.Cointelegraph Spain: Bitcoin’s halving is approaching and everybody is talking about it. What do you expect from it?CZ: The speed of new supply will decrease, and demand is increasing. So, I think the logic is quite simple.“I don't comment on price. I will let everyone make their own judgments. Especially now with the Fed printing so much money, the effect will be real. Some people say I am the counter signal, haha. So they should sell every day, as I am bullish everyday. Probably won't work out too well.”The interview has been shortened and slightly edited for clarity."
42275, Coinbase Migrates Tezos Bakery From US to Ireland With 60 Seconds of Downtime ,2020-03-31t18:22:00+01:00,3373,106,"Coinbase reports that it migrated its Tezos (XTZ) staking bakery from the United States to Ireland while incurring just one minute of downtime on March 31.Since launching its staking service for XTZ in 2019, the exchange has come to operate the largest validator in the Tezos network.Regulatory needs of Tezos ETP provider sparks Coinbase bakery migrationThe Irish migration of Coinbase Custody’s Tezos Bakery was necessitated by the regulatory needs of Swiss digital asset product provider Amun.In 2019, Amun launched the first Tezos-based exchange-traded product on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Coinbase provides both custody and baking services to Amun. Changes to Amun’s regulatory framework reportedly required that their staking activities occur within the European Union.Balancing security against downtimeCoinbase states that it initially identified two strategies for migrating staking to Ireland.The first was to stop its validator in the US before deploying the Irish validator — which, despite requiring approximately one hour in downtime, would keep security risks minimal.The second option considered would have seen Coinbase begin its Irish validator before ceasing the process in the US — opening the exercise to significant security risks should both validators operate simultaneously.Coinbase decouples the validator’s endorserIn the end, however, the exchange determined that the best course of action was to decouple the validator’s endorser from its node to “perform an almost downtime-free migration.” The firm explained:“A Tezos validator has two main components: the baker, which produces new blocks that include transactions in the digital ledger, and the endorser, which votes on blocks that other validators produce [...] Large Tezos validators typically only produce or bake new blocks every few minutes or hours, but they need to vote or endorse almost every minute.”After successfully decoupling and migrating the endorser during a single minute of downtown, Coinbase found that it was voting or endorsing blocks from Ireland while producing new blocks in the US.Coinbase later found a two-hour window suited to migrating the baker — completing the migration."

42269," Bitcoin Hash Rate Drop: Miners, the Halving and Coronavirus Suspected ",2020-03-31t16:35:00+01:00,6777,156,"The Bitcoin (BTC) network hash rate took a steep dive on March 26, dropping by a whopping 15.95%, which is a 45% sink from its peak highs of 2020. The hash rate dipped from 136.2 quintillion hashes per second on March 1 to just 75.7 EH/s on March 26, according to data from Blockchain.com.Analytics website Coin Dance reported similar findings, with the 2020 peak standing at about 150 EH/s on March 5 and then dropping to 105.6 EH/s 10 days later, thus showing a 29% decrease.The combined effects of the hash rate decrease and the ensuing outflow of miners from the market have resulted in arguably one of the biggest blows to the Bitcoin network since 2011. The negative impact is difficult to fully assess at this time. However, the reasons for the slump are disputable and are being attributed to a number of factors — from the upcoming BTC halving and the raging coronavirus pandemic to a worldwide recession causing miners to leave the market.Why is this happening?The Bitcoin network’s hash rate is designed in such a way that it adjusts the computational difficulty of the mining process after every 2,016 blocks — which happens about every two weeks. The correlation is directly proportional: If the hash rate goes up, so does the computational difficulty and vice versa. The given measure is designed to increase the challenge of mining blocks, making the process more rewarding.The 15.5% drop has directly impacted the decrease in mining difficulty from a measurement of 16.5 trillion to 13.9 trillion on March 26, meaning that a large number of miners had disconnected from the chain. Such a turn of events was expected after the past month’s turbulent events, which saw Bitcoin roller-coasting to $3,600, showing a 60% decline. As a result, many miners allegedly found it unprofitable to keep mining and running the equipment, which consumes a lot of electricity.Are miners really leaving the market?Hash rates and mining difficulty are directly correlated and have historically been the trendsetters of the so-called “miners’ capitulation cycle,” which signifies that mining is profitable as long as the BTC price remains high. As the computation difficulty rises, miners with low-powered equipment are forced to sell off their assets to keep mining, which leads to an increase in the supply of Bitcoin. When miners are unable to compete, they leave the market, and this leads to a decrease in the hash rate.Walter Salama, the chief compliance officer of mining company Bitpatagonia, told Cointelegraph that he is inclined to think that the departure of the miners has contributed to the decline of the hash rate:“All miners invest for a long-term business and contribute to blockchain. The medium to small miners, many are closing, we have all made the same mistakes, we have entered the industry with very high costs of the machines and with a Bitcoin that never stopped falling in value and when we had an attractive price to sell and recover, we did not have stock because we were always forced to badly sell to survive.”Pierce Crosby, the general manager of TradingView, explained to Cointelegraph that a lot of the volatility of the hash rate is based on programmatic price limits set for different mining rigs. Because of the math on hash rate rewards, the lower the price, the lower the margin per computation, so these rigs will likely slow down until the price rebounds and margins expand, Crosby said.The theory was put into practice on March 26 and led to a reset of the network’s computation difficulty. As the difficulty shifted downward, the miners’ capitulation cycle closed the full circle. This may continue until only the strongest remain, highlighting one of the fundamental flaws of the Bitcoin network.Related: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedHowever, many experts disagree that the recent BTC hash rate drop has anything to do with miners capitulating. Donnell Wright, a miner and blockchain compliance consultant, told Cointelegraph:“Miners could be capitulating, but I don’t think that is what is happening now, especially so close to the BTC halving. Usually, after the halving, we end up seeing a huge spike in price, so based on previous data, it would be detrimental to capitulate.”Other contributing factorsThere could be a number of reasonable explanations, however, as to why the BTC network hash rate has taken a decline, as added by Wright:“It could be that miners are competing with newer technology, so they may have to shut off current miners to upgrade. It’s also likely that mining operations may be forced to temporarily shut down due to COVID-19, depending on the region. I don’t believe the decline is linked to the halving, which may actually incentivize bigger players to mine — after the fact.”Vector Moranov, miner and member of the Bitcoin Foundation, noted to Cointelegraph that apart from a direct relationship between the BTC hash rate drop of March 2020 and the Bitcoin price, miners also have fears of an economic crisis that might happen due to the coronavirus pandemic.A decrease in the hash rate could also be caused by a deficit of miners and the closure of farms and production in China, as well as the rise in the price of the equipment. Over 30% of the mining takes place in China, according to Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of Crebaco, a research and intelligence firm focused on blockchain and crypto projects, further told Cointelegraph:“China being under a lockdown is one of the reasons why the hash rate has reduced because the mining facilities are not operating at its best capacities.”Sogani added that new ASIC mining machines upgraded specially for the upcoming BTC halving have been affected as well. The pandemic tossed a wrench into the introduction schedule of new mining rigs, resulting in a sell-off of BTC. Considering the immense upgrade of hardware that took place in 2019, the service life of that equipment may be coming to an end, as the almost twofold hash rate increase over the first quarter of 2020 has compressed the operating margins.In addition, Bitcoin corrected its price by introducing a multiplier effect on low margins, leading to the capitulation of inefficient miners. The monthly production by miners of over 54,000 new Bitcoin every block is also battering the coin’s price, resulting in excess in supply.The pressure to sell Bitcoin in order to maintain mining equipment is immense, as miners may still try to get significant profit margins. This leads to a “survival of the fittest” situation, as experienced miners with high margins will be accumulating a larger percentage of the newly minted Bitcoin and will not be selling them to maintain their operations.Despite the technical aspect, the impact of COVID-19 and the sharp drop of the S&P 500 on the BTC’s price are also strong contributing factors that could decrease the interest of miners in the coin. Vincent Poon, a vice president at Bithumb Global, noted the economic situation as the factor that affected BTC’s hash rate most of all. He told Cointelegraph:“I believe the miners didn’t quit the game, the hash rate drop is due to the global turmoils similar to others assets and the cash out of the Ponzi schemes which there are still a handful of them out there. Historically speaking, halving did increase the price in short term. Miners are well aware of halving and is a calculated risk when they invested in mining machines. Some miners might quit but that also means they got more market share, which is a good thing for the miners in general.”Possible scenarioEverything depends on BTC’s price and global market conditions, as a significant drop in mining difficulty and the possible rise of BTC above the $6,000 mark could still make older mining equipment like Bitmain’s Antminer S9 profitable. The cryptocurrency mining market and miners are very much active, just operating differently, according to Stephen Gregory, the chief compliance officer of crypto exchange CEX.io U.S. He claimed in an email conversation with Cointelegraph:“Last week, in addition to a monthly CME settlement date, we saw over 50% of open interest options expired in Bitcoin alone. To me, this shows that perhaps miners may take some machines offline to cut costs but are still very much active in the market using the ever-expanding array of financial instruments to hedge their risks effectively. Although the theory of the ‘miner’s capitulation cycle,’ [...] still has merit; now that miners can hedge with options and futures, means there is more than one route to generating yield.”Meanwhile, the situation has led many miners to start switching between the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) networks to remain profitable. However, that may start changing on April 8 when BCH is set to halve its block reward. The same will happen to BTC on around May 15.The long-term prognosis is that the hash rate will go up as mining is institutionalized, according to Wright. He told Cointelegraph:“Enterprises will also continue to find innovative ways to mine BTC without using as much energy and power. This alone might introduce new institutional players into the space, which will allow hash to continue to break all-time highs.”The derivation of the current situation directly shifts to the near future and poses questions about the state of Bitcoin after the halving if miners are the primary source of sell pressure. Matt D'Souza gave a laconic answer to the rhetorical question in his Twitter post: “50% less potential pressure.” In other words, miners with low margins are immensely affected by any negative price movements and will leave the network.Some miners share this point of view. The Bitcoin Foundation’s Moranov told Cointelegraph that although some miners will shut down their devices in the short term, there will be a big wave of miners abandoning the market in the long run if the decline continues, especially because of Bitcoin’s halving.However, many experts have also suggested positive scenarios. Miner capitulation has historically been a buy signal, and a bull market always follows periods of recession, as the post-Bitcoin-halving world could see an outflow of miners and a reward redistribution under lower sell pressure — which could potentially result in a Bitcoin price increase.Sogani told Cointelegraph that although Bitcoin’s price may fall right away. In his opinion, BTC should break its all-time price high in no more than six months time, adding:“That’s not because of the halving but because of excessive printing of money by the central banks globally to combat COVID-19 and control the recession. Printing of money does help in the short run, but in a few months, we will see that this recession will turn into a depression which will last for over 24 months.”Wright also shared with Cointelegraph his positive prognosis on post-BTC halving prices, saying that in the long term, the decline in the hash rate will not have an impact and that a price uptrend will accompany volatility after the halving, adding: “The hash rate reached all-time highs in January 2019, and the price was not following, which yielded confusion and then BTC took a trip to $14K shortly after.”D’Souza gave a more precise prediction, pointing to a period of one year and stating that the “recessions typically suppress most assets — especially risk-on assets, such as Bitcoin. We don’t call bottoms. Historically, during miner capitulation, 12-month returns have been favorable.” However, there are analysts who suggest that the hash rate may further drop. For instance, Crosby opined:“The deterioration of different coin hash rates is visible to the larger investor community and, behaviorally, creates pessimism about the fundamental value of a currency. If this is ‘acted’ on, then price declines further, and hash rate will further decline as well. Downward spiral.”"
42268," Russia Postpones Its Crypto Law Again, Now Blaming Coronavirus ",2020-03-31t15:51:00+01:00,3373,124,"After facing multiple delays, the adoption of Russia’s major cryptocurrency law will be postponed again, now due to the coronavirus.Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, says that the country’s crypto law — the bill “On Digital Financial Assets” — is now finalized but won’t be adopted before the end of the spring 2020.Russian authorities have been arguing about crypto regulation since January 2018According to a March 31 report by Russian news agency RBC, Aksakov has admitted that previous delays in the bill’s adoption were caused by disagreement on the new asset type between local authorities. Aksakov, who is also chairman of National Banking Council at Russia’s central bank, reportedly elaborated that the central bank opposed legalization of crypto while the State Duma advocated some crypto initiatives.However, the long-awaited law is being postponed for another reason now. As Russia shifts its focus to priority actions against the COVID-19 pandemic, all legislative processes have slowed down, Aksakov reportedly noted. As reported by Cointelegraph, the bill has seen a number of delays after first being introduced in January 2018.Aksakov says that Russia’s crypto law will not hinder operation of local crypto exchangesAksakov reportedly added that Russia’s upcoming crypto law will provide a definition of cryptocurrencies and prohibit the use of crypto as payment. Additionally, the law will include the issuance and circulation of digital assets, the official reportedly noted. However, in mid-March, a legal executive at Russia’s central bank said that the bill would ban the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrencies.Aksakov also emphasized that the new law won’t hinder operation of crypto exchanges in case they won’t be violating it. The official also highlighted that the bill “On Digital Financial Assets” won’t include regulations regarding cryptocurrency mining. However, Aksakov expressed confidence that profits from crypto mining should be taxed, noting that crypto mining is a “type of business that produces value.”Aksakov’s latest remarks about the new delay in adopting Russia’s upcoming crypto law comes subsequent to Russia recording its biggest one-day rise in coronavirus cases for the sixth day in a row. As reported by Reuters, Moscow’s authorities have already ordered residents to self-isolate, while the nationwide lockdown is being considered.On March 24, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation reportedly released a draft law that would allow the testing of cryptocurrency and blockchain developments within a special regulatory sandbox."
42265, ‘Prime Brokerage’ for Crypto: Apifiny Launches Institutional Platform to Connect Exchange Liquidity ,2020-03-31t15:40:00+01:00,1923,94,"Institutions will now be able to trade on every single crypto market simultaneously thanks to GlobalX, an API platform launched on March 31 by San Francisco-based firm Apifiny. The startup hired former executives of Google X, Kraken and AlphaPoint to promote the service.Specifically, Josh Li will act as Apifiny’s chief business officer, having previous experience in Google and Google X, Alphabet’s innovation arm. Michael Fertman will lead the B2B marketing efforts as VP Marketing of Apifiny, coming from the security tokens startup AlphaPoint.Finally, Scott Eilbeck was brought on as VP of strategic partnerships and institutional sales. He recently served as head of Over the Counter (OTC) markets at Kraken, while counting JP Morgan and Bear Stearns under past experiences.Cointelegraph spoke with Li, Fertman and Apifiny’s CTO, Ashu Swami, to learn more about the GlobalX platform.Connecting global liquidityGlobalX works by integrating all of the world’s exchanges into one platform available to institutional traders. The firm opens business accounts with as many exchanges as possible across the entire world, while presenting a unified interface to its clients.As Swami explained, the immediate reason for this is simple — it allows institutional traders to make large orders without depressing the price on one specific exchange.By distributing the order across global markets, the traders tap into global crypto liquidity, instead of just one crypto exchange. But there are other benefits, as he elaborated:“These quantitative hedge funds are in the business of finding patterns. Even with things like ‘how does the sunrise and clouds affect stock prices?’ Very hypothetical things. And by being able to access the global prices in regional markets, they can create and implement different kinds of new strategies.”Furthermore, some exchanges also limit the number of orders in a given period of time. Spreading the load between multiple platforms would allow to decrease latency and increase trading frequency, as Swami explained.The core proposition of GlobalX is “increasing the bandwidth” available for institutional trading desks. As Fertman highlighted, trading on multiple exchanges is complex:“If you look at before, in order to execute these global strategies, an institutional investor would have to set up accounts on multiple exchanges, globally. In order to execute rapidly, they would need separate sets of APIs to different exchanges. [...] On the front end, it is the equivalent of calling 17 different brokers to execute one trade, and not through one interface.”GlobalX also provides a function that few institutional trading desks can have on their own — access to all local fiat-to-crypto markets.Connecting them can also be a way to use crypto for trading opportunities between traditional foreign exchange markets, Swami said.Is this a crypto broker?Crypto exchanges are, in traditional terms, a combination of both an exchange and a broker. Generally, only very high-value clients can directly access traditional exchanges, while retail buyers can only do so through brokers.GlobalX can be seen as reintroducing the concept of a broker, as its clients will not necessarily have accounts with the exchanges they trade on. When asked about this, Li replied:“I think what we are doing is somewhat unique in that we're trying to really build this new way of doing business. [...] We're not directly competing with exchanges, we see them as strategic partners. We’re trying to help solve this global problem where liquidity pools are isolated to only a specific country or set of customers.”Swami highlighted that the worlds of crypto and traditional securities are very different. He replied:“This industry is evolving in an organic fashion. And it's very hard to use the existing securities industry’s labels and slap them on the activities that we are doing. But if you had to draw the closest analogy then I think our role is that of a prime broker.”In traditional markets, prime brokerage is usually provided by investment banks to hedge funds to satisfy some specialized needs.GlobalX could be considered as a sign that the crypto industry is maturing as an asset class. Its team stressed that connecting global liquidity could finally bring large institutional investors on board."

This, it said, would get worse before it got better.Coin Metrics expects “pattern of capitulation”Despite BTC/USD recovering over 70% in two weeks since hitting lows of $3,700, prices are still “almost certainly declined below the breakeven price” for less efficient miners.This is supported by the recent drop in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, which at nearly 16% was the largest negative move since 2011. Before the mining sector recovers, more pain is in store.“We expect miners to follow a cycle of decreased profit margins, increased selling, capitulation, and a culling of the least efficient miners from the network,” the report summarizes.“Once this cycle is complete, the miner industry should return to a healthier state that is supportive of future price increases.”Bitcoin mining difficulty 6-month chart.

Next month, hard forks BCH and BSV will both undergo a block reward halving — reducing the number of coins awarded to miners each block by 50%.Bitcoin’s own halving will only occur in mid-May and will halve the supply for miners from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.This gives a one-month window during which miners will direct more hash power to BTC, as its block reward will be higher, despite the increased costs, says Coin Metrics.“When Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV halve their block rewards, this should force miners to direct even more hash power to Bitcoin as it will still have a 12.5 native unit block reward (instead of 6.25) for about a month longer,” the report adds.“Therefore, we should expect difficulty increases for Bitcoin that should further squeeze profit margins for all miners.”As Cointelegraph reported, analysts, particularly those who support the stock-to-flow price model for Bitcoin, are keenly awaiting the impact of the halving. At some point in 2021, and until 2024, stock-to-flow states, BTC/USD should trade at an average of $100,000."
42261," During Coronavirus Pandemic, IRS Cuts Taxpayers Some Much Needed Slack ",2020-03-31t14:49:00+01:00,5054,79,"Crypto communities and the United States Internal Revenue Service haven’t exactly had a love fest over the last five years. It started in 2014, when the IRS said crypto was property, and it hasn’t got much better since. In addition to sending those 10,000 “beware” letters and trying to get crypto exchanges to turn over customer lists, the IRS has even gone so far as to alter the most hallowed tax form, Form 1040, to ask a crypto-specific question.However, the IRS is actually making a big effort to cut all taxpayers — and that includes the crypto community too — some much needed slack during this unprecedented time. It started when the head of the IRS, Commissioner Chuck Rettig, announced the “People First Initiative.” Need to pay your taxes in installments? The IRS will help and has a well-worn process for working out installment payments.What if you have an existing installment agreement, but can’t make your payments right now? The IRS says installment payments due between April 1 and July 15 are suspended. It says this also applies in the case of direct deposit installment agreements, so you can suspend payments during this period. It says it will not default any installment agreements during this period. How about an offer in compromise, also known as an OIC?As with installment agreements, the IRS allows some people to pay a part of what they owe and have the rest written off by the IRS. It is based on ability to pay and other factors, and there is an established procedure to go through to try to get the IRS to accept your proposal. The IRS is giving people more time to submit materials.Haven’t filed a return? The IRS says over 1 million households that haven’t filed tax returns during the last three years are owed refunds, so fill out those returns!Once delinquent returns are filed, taxpayers who owe money should consider an installment agreement or an OIC.Tax liens and levies are also generally being suspended during this period. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien is normally sent out almost automatically when the IRS is owed taxes, serving as a way to insure by public notice that it will eventually get paid. A levy, on the other hand, involves the IRS actually collecting owed taxes by allowing it to take funds directly from a bank account upon deposit. The fact that the IRS is trying to ease up on both during this time is significant. Even new passport debt certifications when delinquent tax debts exceed $50,000 are on hold too.New tax audits are on hold too. One exception is when the IRS needs to act right away to protect the government’s interest in preserving the applicable statute of limitations. Usually, the statute of limitations is three years, but that’s not always the case: Here are some rules everyone should know. The IRS will continue to take steps where necessary to protect all applicable statutes of limitations. The IRS may ask taxpayers to extend the statute, or when needed, will issue notices of deficiency.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Robert W.

42259, Bitfury Becomes Latest Crypto Industry Player to Join COVID-19 Research Project ,2020-03-31t15:00:00+01:00,1514,87,"Blockchain development firm Bitfury is re-assigning the computing power it uses for digital currency transaction processing to COVID-19 research.In an announcement on March 31, the company revealed that it had been allocating its high-powered GPU-enabled computing nodes to run COVID-19 calculations as of March 20.The redirection of Bitfury’s resources is contributing to a distributed computing endeavor, Folding@Home (F@H), created by a consortium of scientific research labs across North America, Europe and Asia.In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, F@H has launched a project to run simulations of the virus’ molecular structure in an effort to contribute to the development of effective therapeutics.The project, which demands enormous computational power, has been seeking donations of computational resources from enterprises, organizations and individuals.Bitfury, for its part, has reportedly to date used its nodes to complete over 1,300 calculations for the F@H initiative.In a statement, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov said he was “confident that this project from Folding at Home, alongside the work of many researchers and doctors, will significantly advance our understanding and treatment of this disease.”Strong backing from the crypto industryAs Cointelegraph has previously reported, Bitfury is just the latest of a series of crypto industry players to join the F@H project.The project has received support from decentralized computing network Golem, and blockchain platform Tezos (XTZ), who earmarked a donation pool of several hundred XTZ to be awarded to the largest F@H donor at the end of this month.As of March 12, Tezos has had 20 teams contributing resources to the project. U.S.-based Ether (ETH) miner Coreweave has diverted the computational power of roughly 6,000 GPUs, as well as major chip manufacturer Nvidia. In mid-March, Nvidia also appealed to individual gamers to contribute their own unused GPU computing resources to the research effort."
42257, Crypto Conference Defies COVID-19 Lockdown by Hosting in Virtual Realm ,2020-03-31t13:50:00+01:00,2242,132,"The COVID-19 crisis may have put a stop to millions of sports events, work conferences and meet-ups across the world, but it has not halted those in the cryptocurrency space.The Coinfest Conference, which runs until April 4, has found a way to defy the coronavirus lockdown by setting up shop in the digital blockchain realm of Decentraland.The first day of the virtual conference kicked off on March 30th, beginning with a round of games that offered users the chance to win MANA tokens — one of Decentraland’s native currencies.Nearby museums and art galleries (seen below) offer visitors the chance to take in original art exhibits hosted within the virtual realm.In-world screenshot of the Museum DistrictApril 1 sees attendees relocate to coordinate point (61,-27) to Decentraland’s MetaZone, described as a “virtual fairground [...] with fireworks, food stalls, gazebos and gardens.” The main attraction will be a four-story tall tower of blockchain games, with players given the chance to win more MANA tokens.The third day of the conference takes place across multiple coordinate points, including a nightclub, the Sugar Club. Also open for visitors is free entry to Ross Tower — a digital tribute to imprisoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Five venues in total will comprise the landscape for a treasure-hunt, with winners being rewarded with Ether (ETH).The final day of the event takes place at the Decentraland Conference Center on April 4, where presentations will be made via a virtual projector. Nearby attractions include a meditation garden, a temple and a theater district. A dance party has also been scheduled for 5pm UTC at a nearby cafe.In-world screenshot of the Conference CenterRelocation to Decentraland’s Digital RealmThe Coinfest Conference is a free annual event that normally runs in multiple locations around the world simultaneously. On March 17, the creators of the event notified followers on Twitter that all event locations hosted in Europe and North America would be canceled due to the coronavirus lockdown.The hosts initially hoped the Africa-based locations would still go ahead, but by March 21 it was announced that those too had been canceled.Decentraland (MANA) launched in 2017, and comprises over 90,000 “parcels” of digital land — represented by LAND tokens. The dimensions of those parcels are 10 square meters, equating to a virtual landscape that’s 9 square kilometers in size (not including vertical space).In May 2019 a 64-block parcel of land known as “The Secret of Satoshis Tea Garden” sold for $80,663, or 1,299,999 MANA."
42255, Institution-Focused Crypto Trading Platform Reports 737% Revenue Increase in 2019 ,2020-03-31t12:38:00+01:00,2277,72,"Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed BC Group, the operator of institution-focused digital assets trading platform OSL, reported a 737% increase in revenue in 2019.On March 31, BC Group revealed that its OSL digital assets platform had been its largest 2019 earner, accounting for 44% of the Group’s revenues — up from just 6% in 2018.The OSL digital assets platform offers institutions services that include over-the-counter brokerage, Software-as-a-Service tools, custodial services and institutional digital asset exchange.Regulatory progressTotal year-on-year revenue for BC Group in 2019 was RMB72 million ($10 million) — up 737% from the previous year, as noted above.This increase in revenue was accompanied by OSL’s submission of an application for licenses to conduct regulated activities under the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s new regulatory framework for digital asset trading platforms.Submitted in November 2019, the license application is judged by the firm to be a milestone in its digital assets business development, with BC Group CFO Steve Zhang stating:“We view the introduction of licensing for digital assets in Hong Kong in 2020 as an inflection point. This will galvanise institutional participation in the digital asset space and accelerate growth of BC Group and our OSL digital asset platform business as traditional securities continue to digitize.”Noting that the digital asset securities market is forecast to grow by over 5,000% to $11 trillion by 2024, BC Group says it has focused its energies on strengthening management and rebranding is digital assets products and services.Strategies include opening a new OSL office in Singapore in July 2019, intensifying SaaS sales efforts to major institutions, and issuing a $36 million share placement in January 2020 to fund continued expansion.Despite the turmoil in world markets amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the firm does not believe this will impede the transition of financial services towards digital assets.In February, Cointelegraph reported that Fidelity International had acquired a stake in BC Group, purchasing 17 million shares for a 5.6% ownership position."
42251, Blockchain Project Says 5 GB Block Size Will Eliminate Congestion Issue ,2020-03-31t11:08:00+01:00,4299,288,"A company says its blockchain network offers the world’s largest block size of 5 gigabytes, having been certified by Palo Alto Networks Partner.The verification of this block size followed successful testing on a live blockchain network. ILCoin notes this was made possible thanks to the routing in fat trees protocol, known as RIFT, which enabled the block size to increase without having a negative impact on transaction speeds.Crypto enthusiasts are also being given the opportunity to verify the 5 GB block for themselves via the ILCoin Block Explorer, under number 310280.At a time when major blockchains like Bitcoin have suffered substantial delays confirming transactions, with heightened demand affecting volatility,ILCoin notes its infrastructure is becoming increasingly vital. Many blockchain platforms have openly acknowledged that scalability is one of the biggest challenges they face, especially as cryptocurrencies gain greater awareness in the public sphere.Discussing ILCoin’s achievement, its executive manager, Norbert Goffa, said: “RIFT protocol disrupts the very concept of blockchain, mainly with the idea that simultaneous asynchronization is, in fact, technically possible. With RIFT, we are able to solve both the FIFO and the bottleneck problems and manage large blocks at unprecedented speed.”How the RIFT protocol worksAccording to ILCoin, the RIFT protocol has been specifically designed to tackle scalability problems that have hindered the industry’s progress for some years.RIFT boasts a two-layer structure, and irrespective of their size and their order in the chain, blocks are synchronized simultaneously. The company says this prevents bottlenecks from forming in the system during peak periods and enhances overall transaction speeds. It claims 5 GB blocks can operate at speeds of hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, paving the way for “safe and efficient” on-chain storage.More insights from ILCoin hereThe benefits of this protocol also extend beyond time, since it could ultimately make transactions far less expensive for consumers in the long run.Goffa has written extensively about the advantages of the RIFT protocol, describing it as “the beginning of an entirely new blockchain approach” that eliminates the limitations suffered by industry giants, including Ethereum.The power of on-chain storageILCoin says that the modernization of data storage is badly needed, as current solutions often leave businesses underserved.According to the company, its solution means large volumes of data can be stored securely and without the risk of critical information being manipulated or changed without the network owner’s consent. This is particularly beneficial for data of a sensitive nature, creating an environment that’s free of corruption, theft and other unlawful activities.Explaining how ILCoin’s approach is different from the countless other enterprise solutions currently under development, Goffa wrote: “Today’s environment is quite interesting because, even though the whole world is talking about decentralization, large companies that focus on blockchain development are still building off-chain solutions that will continue to result in centralized data storage.”Goffa believes that, thanks to the RIFT protocol, it will be possible to establish a digital financial network that offers “the lowest transaction fees currently available in the world on an on-chain basis.”Main focusThe company’s main focus is the Decentralized Cloud Blockchain, otherwise known as DCB for short. This on-chain solution allows data storage and data exchange to be realized on a transparent basis, “forming a transparent unity of ownership and permanence.” ILCoin will serve as the “stable, safe and widely accepted payment method” that underpins this infrastructure.Exciting milestones that stretch into other sectors are set to follow later this year. In June, ILCoin is hoping to launch the world’s first blockchain-based virtual reality game, and by December, following extensive testing, the company has the ambition of allowing users to build their very own smart contract systems.Learn more about ILCoinDisclaimer.

42250, BMW’s Blockchain Solution for Supply Chains to Roll Out in 2020 ,2020-03-31t11:03:00+01:00,6594,348,"World-famous car manufacturer BMW Group plans to roll out its blockchain supply chain solution to 10 suppliers this year.Dubbed “PartChain,” the platform has already been successfully tested by BMW in 2019, an official announcement on March 31 revealed.In its early version, PartChain is designed to ensure traceability and immediate data transparency for automobile components across complex supply chains that engage multiple international parties.The 2019 pilot implemented the solution for purchasing and tracking front lights, with the involvement of two of BMW Group’s total 31 plants, as well as three locations of the supplier Automotive Lighting.Andreas Wendt — a member of BMW AG’s Board of Management, who is responsible for the Group’s purchasing and supplier network — said that BMW now wants to expand the project to “a large number” of other suppliers, with 10 selected for 2020.Combining blockchain with cloud technologyIn the long-term, Wendt said that BMW’s vision is to use blockchain to create “an open platform that will allow data within supply chains to be exchanged and shared safely and anonymized across the industry.”Whereas the pilot had been limited to component tracking, BMW sees the platform’s future applications extending to tracing critical raw materials for manufacturing “from mine to smelter.”Together with blockchain — which provides for tamper-proof, verifiable data collection and transaction — PartChain uses cloud technologies from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.Intra-industry developmentWendt revealed that BMW now intends to share the PartChain solution with other members of the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), which BMW co-founded back in 2018.As Cointelegraph reported at the time, MOBI is the result of a collaboration between BMW, GM, Ford and Renault — as well as high-profile blockchain, tech and engineering firms including Bosch, Hyperledger, IBM and IOTA.The project has led to the creation of the MOBI Vehicle Identity Standard, which aims to establish a blockchain-based database for Vehicle Identity Numbers. This supports unique digital certificates for information such as vehicle identity, ownership, warranties and current mileage, which can be securely stored in an electronic wallet."
42248, SEC Claims Telegram Injunction Applies to ‘Any Person or Entity’ ,2020-03-31t10:47:00+01:00,2842,97,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has opposed Telegram’s request for clarity regarding the geographic scope of a court injunction barring the company from distributing its Gram (GRAM) tokens.In a letter to Judge Castel dated March 30, the SEC asserts that the injunction “unambiguously, and properly, applies to Telegram’s delivery of Grams to ‘any person or entity’ [...] and requires no clarification.”The Gram tokens correspond to the firm’s $1.7 billion initial coin offering that raised money to launch the Telegram Open Network — or TON — in 2018.SEC claims injunction unambiguously applies to “any person or entity”On March 27, Telegram’s lawyers filed a letter requesting that the court clarify whether the court’s March 24 injunction has jurisdiction outside of the United States.The letter noted that while the Supreme Court has previously recognized “a ‘presumption against extraterritorial applications’ of the U.S. securities laws.’” As such, Telegram is seeking to distribute tokens to the investors that represent the $1.27 billion that the firm raised from outside of the United States.The SEC describes Telegram’s letter as “procedurally barred and legally meritless” — citing its injunction request, which sought to prevent Telegram from “delivering Grams to any person or entity or taking any other steps to effect any unregistered offer or sale of Grams.”Despite the firm’s letter being “styled as a request for ‘clarity,’” the SEC asserts that “Telegram’s request is really a motion for reconsideration in disguise.”TON community may seek to launch network despite court rulingOn March 24, Judge Castel ruled that the SEC had “shown a substantial likelihood of success” in seeking to prove that Telegram’s token issuance would distribute unregistered securities — granting a preliminary injunction against the firm from delivering Gram tokens to investors. Telegram immediately appealed Judge Castel’s ruling.Two days later, the founder of the TON Community Foundation revealed to Cointelegraph that the community was considering launching the network itself, as the code is open-source. Daniel Perez, the head of TON Spain, added:“No one can prevent the launch of TON by any other entity, person or a community, [be]cause TON is a decentralized open-source solution. Already, there are two different test networks, and within the community, there is at least 1 group planning to launch the third.”"
42247, Voatz Bug Bounty Kicked Off of HackerOne Platform ,2020-03-31t10:33:00+01:00,2234,96,"For the first time in its history, bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure firm HackerOne has kicked a company off its platform.Blockchain-based voting company Voatz has long touted its bug bounty program through HackerOne when asked about the security of its blockchain-enabled mobile voting app.Founded in 2012, HackerOne connects businesses with pen testers and cybersecurity researchers. It has hosted over 1,800 customer programs, but the beleaguered Massachusetts-based company’s bug bounty is no longer one of them.“As a platform, we work tirelessly to foster that mutually beneficial relationship between security teams and the researcher community,” HackerOne spokesperson Samantha Spielman told Cointelegraph. “We partner with organizations that prioritize acting in good faith towards the security researcher community and providing adequate access to researchers for testing. Because the Voatz program did not adhere to either of those requirements, we terminated our partnership in March 2020.”In a statement, a Voatz spokesperson attributed HackerOne’s decision to boot them off the platform to “pressure from a small group of researchers” who “believe Voatz reported a researcher to the FBI.” In fact, Voatz reported the student to the jurisdiction which then reported it to the FBI.Voatz faced criticism after the student security researcher was referred to the FBI over what the company says was an intrusion attempt—even though that research appears to have been protected by the safe harbor statement in the company’s bug bounty program. After the FBI referral made headlines, Voatz retroactively updated its HackerOne bug bounty program terms to narrow the scope of its safe harbor policy, making it unclear whether it even provided full legal protection.“Trust is paramount throughout the bug bounty model between security teams, hackers and the platform. Once trust is broken, it’s hard to rebuild. While Voatz was able to surface and resolve vulnerabilities through their bug bounty program, the program was no longer productive for either party,” said Spielman.Independent security researcher and avid bug bounty hunter Jack Cable said that Voatz was slow to even confirm the two bug bounty reports he filed. In one instance, he found a vulnerability—Voatz storing private keys from Stack Overflow on its app—that Voatz said had no role in its election process. However, a security audit by Trail of Bits suggested it was in use in certain functionality and was listed as a high-severity bug.“There are a lot of cases where they tried to downplay the severity of something or weren’t too clear about whether it was even a vulnerability. Overall, it was just not a very productive experience,” Cable said.Cable also found his IP address blocked when testing the app, though he says it is unclear whether this was automated. “There were a couple times when I was testing and I was no longer able to even on their staging environment because my IP address was blocked,” he said.MIT researchers who identified serious security flaws with Voatz found many vulnerabilities that would have been outside of the scope of the bug bounty program, had they gone through it. Instead, they went through CISA. “We wanted the research to speak for itself, and had legal concerns about Voatz’s unprofessional response to prior independent security research, as has been documented in multiple news outlets,” the researchers wrote in an FAQ.Cable pointed to Voatz’s “general hostility to security research as a whole.” Voatz denied security vulnerabilities described in an MIT report, even after it was confirmed by Trail of Bits, the auditing firm it hired. “On one hand, they're saying, ‘come tell us about the vulnerabilities you find.’ But then when people actually find vulnerabilities, they deny that they even exist,” he said.“They're clearly not receptive to security research. HackerOne has a responsibility to protect not only its customers, but also hackers on its platform as soon as the company starts crossing that line. I think HackerOne had to act, so I’m glad that they did in this case.”Voatz said it plans to announce a comprehensive bug bounty program in the coming days."

42243, Civic Wallet Now Offers $1M ‘FDIC-Like Insurance’ for Crypto ,2020-03-31t09:33:00+01:00,2119,189,"Civic Wallet is a multi-signature non-custodial wallet that now comes with a $1,000,000 guarantee from Coincover.Civic Technologies (CVC) has been known in the crypto space as one of the leading providers of decentralized identity and is now purportedly the first company to offer a non-custodial wallet with $1,000,000 protection. The wallet is currently in private beta.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Civic co-founder and CEO, Vinny Lingham compared its key feature to the protection offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC):“This is the first time that both technical and non-technical users can feel safe about their holdings. Until now, people had to keep their coins in the cold storage, but now they don’t have to worry about it as their holdings are insured up to $1,000,000 just like a bank account with the FDIC.”Coincover CEO, David Janczewski said, “Coincover is not an insurance company, we like to think of ourselves as ‘protection and security company for cryptocurrency’, for the insurance, we work with Lloyd’s of London underwriters.”Inheritance benefitsThis being a multi-signature wallet, one key is stored by the user, another by the custodian BitGo, and the third one, currently by Civic, but will eventually migrate to Coincover. According to Lingham, one of the main benefits of this insurance is that in case Civic goes under, users will not lose their coins.Another major advantage is the ability of legal heirs to recover funds through Coincover. For now, the coverage is only available to the United States residents but in the future, it will be extended globally and will include all the coins supported by BitGo.Lingham noted that the coverage is free, but in the future Civic may start charging a fee on the accounts containing over $1,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency.Civic Wallet users must still abide by stringent Know Your Customer requirements by supplying their government-issued identification and subjecting their visage to facial recognition software.Users will also be able to connect their bank accounts and buy crypto without leaving the wallet.As wallets containing higher amounts of cryptocurrency continue to grow in number, an insurance policy could not have come at a better time."

42237, Tokyo District Court Extends Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Plan Deadline ,2020-03-31t04:48:00+01:00,1926,84,"The trustee of now-defunct Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has extended the deadline for the submission of rehabilitation plans.According to an official announcement published on the company’s website on March 30, Mt. Gox Rehabilitation Trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi filed a motion with the Tokyo District Court to extend the submission deadline of a rehabilitation plan. On March 27, the court released an order to extend the deadline to July 1, 2020.Kobayashi was granted a similar extension in April 2019, which pushed the deadline at that time to October.Deadline moved due to ‘matters that require closer examination’Once a rehabilitation plan is submitted, former Mt. Gox crypto and fiat currency holders may be able to receive some of their funds back. However, the wording of the announcement is vague, citing “matters that require closer examination with regard to the rehabilitation plan” as the reason for the delay.The fall of crypto exchange Mt. GoxAs Cointelegraph has reported, the 2011 Mt. Gox hack and subsequent collapse in early 2014 affected nearly 24,000 creditors, mainly those holding cryptocurrency. These events resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC, approximately $460 million at the time and $5.5 billion as of this writing.Japanese courts approved a petition for the exchange to begin civil rehabilitation in June 2018. Koyabashi finally released a draft of this rehabilitation plan on March 24, 2020.Under the proposed draft, former Mt. Gox users who held BTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), fiat currency, and other cryptocurrencies on the platform will have their claims honored. Funds will be allocated toward the rehabilitation proceedings first, with creditors receiving funds thereafter.Other factors at play in the court’s decision?The Tokyo District Court’s decision came the day before a “soft lockdown” was implemented in the capital city by Mayor Yuriko Koike for March 28-29. Though there has been speculation that Tokyo or all of Japan will begin to enforce more stringent measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, nothing has been announced as of this writing."

42222, Capitulation? BTC Battered by Biggest Mining Difficulty Drop Since 2011 ,2020-03-30t21:41:00+01:00,10039,144,"Bitcoin (BTC) currently sits at $6,370, a slight recovery from the March 27 pullback which saw the price drop nearly 9% in 4 hours. Despite showing some bullish signs, Bitcoin is still down nearly 30% since last Friday.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the crash may have been caused by the recent mining difficulty adjustment of nearly -16%. The difficulty adjustment is how the Bitcoin network adapts to the changing mining power on the network, keeping its issuance rate at a fairly steady level.Cryptocurrency market performance since March 27th. Source: Coin360The change in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty on March 26 was the biggest percentage drop the network has seen in 9 years and the adjustment makes Bitcoin production cheaper for all miners. It also aligns with previous correlations in difficulty drops and short-term losses for the price of BTC.The recent nosedive is reminiscent of the previous price action occurring after the mining difficulty dropped by 7.10% on November 7, 2019. The price saw a 25.81% drop from $9,310.19 to $6,907.4 and this highlighted the strong correlation between the network’s hashrate and Bitcoin’s price action.Bitcoin mining capitulation: A downward spiralAs explained in a recent report by Blockware Solutions, Bitcoin miners are one of the key players in the industry, collectively assuring the issuance of new coins and “distributing” them by selling each for fiat on exchanges. Miners are incentivized to liquidate their new coins to pay for operation costs like hosting and electricity. Every month, 54,000 BTC are mined which equals approximately $332 million at current prices.While the mining difficulty seems like the catalyst for the subsequent price move, it is rather a consequence of Bitcoin mining operations shutting down and increasing sell pressure to stay afloat. Mining difficulty is regulated by the total network hash rate, which means that if a lot of miners leave the network, then the difficulty reduces drastically.This is exactly what happened following the price crash witnessed on March 12 when the price dropped to a 2020 low of $3,775. Mining operations with lower profit margins due to inefficient equipment or higher electricity costs were forced to halt operations as mining became unprofitable. Any Bitcoin held by the mining company may need to be liquidated, further accentuating sell pressure.Unprofitability caused these mining operations to shut down, which in turn caused the mining difficulty to decrease. The network hashrate had been growing throughout 2020, leading to higher production costs and leaving miners unprepared for the BTC crash earlier this month.Bitcoin network hash rate, April 19, 2019–March30, 2020, Source: blockchain.comSurvival of the fittest: Bitcoin’s recoveryThis mining capitulation process doesn’t end there. As Blockware Solutions reported, companies that are better prepared and have access to additional capital and higher profit margins are able to stay on the network even with reduced profits or temporary losses.As less experienced or poorly funded miners are faced with bankruptcy and log off the network, the difficulty adjustments allow for the ones that hold on to enjoy lower costs of production following the difficulty adjustment which takes place every 14 days.This, in turn, allows these operations to become more profitable and to enjoy less selling pressure from other operations. Matt D'Souza explained via Twitter:“After shutting off, Bitcoin they were receiving is allocated to the more efficient, experienced miners with excellent margins who are positioned to accumulate a larger percentage of the newly minted Bitcoin rather than having to sell it — significantly reducing sell pressure”This means that while the short-term effects of the Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment may be negative, they are likely to correct over time as shown in the chart below.Bitcoin Price and mining difficulty correlation from 2011 to date. Source: Blockware SolutionsMiners and traders in the marketThe selling pressure created by miners may seem like a drop in the ocean when compared to volume on exchanges. However, one must remember that falsified trading volume and wash trading practices are still commonplace in the industry. Furthermore, volume on exchanges does not equate to selling pressure given that much of it is back and forth trading rather than the actual liquidation of Bitcoin as miners selling for fiat do.A recent report by Chainalysis shows that nearly 90% of the Bitcoin flowing into exchanges comes from other exchanges as traders leverage arbitrage opportunities and move funds between markets.Excluding other exchanges, Mining pool operators (who are responsible for 92% of newly minted Bitcoins) have conducted 28% of the remaining on-chain transactions into exchanges since 2017. The Chainalysis report reads:“When miners send to exchanges, they are adding new liquidity to the market. This increases the supply of Bitcoin available on the market, potentially lowering the price. Aside from Bitcoin received from other exchanges, mining pools are the most important source of Bitcoin flowing into exchanges, followed by hosted wallets and merchant services.”Origin of Bitcoin received by exchanges, excluding transfers from other exchanges. Source: ChainalysisThe everchanging Bitcoin industryWhile the information above makes a pretty good case for the correlation of the Bitcoin price and mining difficulty changes, there are many nuances that can disrupt this correlation. Take, for example, the sell pressure caused by holders in events like the Bitcoin crash earlier this month.Moreover, miners' behavior can also change over time as operations grow and explore other crypto-based investment opportunities like arbitrage, lending, staking and more.As the mining industry matures, new players are likely to be drawn to mining, as is the case with Atlas Holding, a company that is leasing a New York-based power plant for a large-scale Bitcoin mining operation. When asked about industry developments that could point to a shift in these dynamics, D'Souza told Cointelegraph:“If Bitcoin is further adopted in 10 years, mining will likely be more commoditized and institutionalized which will reduce volatility in the price of Bitcoin. Present commodities like gold, oil or soybeans have large, institutional suppliers while Bitcoin miners are the present suppliers.”There’s a silver lining for minersWhile Bitcoin’s crash on March 12 marked the end of some mining ventures and a giant drop in BTC’s hash rate, the network as a whole seems to be getting back to normal as difficulty adjusts downward, enabling the more efficient miners to gain more market share and thus, making the network more resilient in the long-term.In the meantime, miners that have managed to stay afloat can mine with reduced difficulty and enjoy cheaper production costs due to reduced difficulty which will take nine more days to adjust to the hashrate growth. This may be short-lived as the upcoming Bitcoin halving will see production cut in half and may change the mining landscape going forward.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

According to the firm, this makes OKCoin the first international exchange to obtain a cryptocurrency exchange license through the official application procedure in Japan.OKCoin Japan said that ever since its establishment in September in 2017, it has been preparing itself to be in a position to achieve a business framework that can comply with Japanese law. OKCoin marketing manager added that:“OKCoin wants to get recognition from the Japanese authority in terms of their own technologies, products, teams, compliance & regulation system and internal management system, etc., in this way, they finally get approved by the license.”OKCoin has been expanding its global presence since 2013OKCoin is now officially headquartered in San Francisco and has a number of offices worldwide including Malta.OK Group has expanded its business bases in China, the United States, Europe, Malaysia and the Philippines since its establishment in 2013. With the expansion in Japan, the blockchain company is set to employ over 1,000 globally, OKCoin says.Before OKCoin Japan’s exchange officially launches, users can now pre-register by visiting the firm’s main site to create an account. It will support the Japanese Yen and deal with major crypto assets, including BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, and BCH.As Cointelegraph reported previously, OKCoin added support for the Singaporean dollar earlier this month.

42220, Bank of France Launches Experiment Program on Central Bank Digital Currency ,2020-03-30t21:12:00+01:00,4792,217,"As a number of global jurisdictions like the Bahamas and Sweden are already testing their central bank digital currencies (CBDC), French central bank is getting more straightforward regarding its own CBDC plans.The Bank of France is now officially launching a program of experiments to test the integration of a CBDC for interbank settlements, inviting potential participants to submit their applications.Bank of France doesn’t insist on blockchain implementation for CBDCAccording to a March 30 document, France’s central bank is calling for applications to experiment with the use of a digital euro, aiming to explore the potential CBDC opportunities for clearing and settlement of tokenized financial assets. Although the Bank of France previously called for blockchain-based settlement systems in Europe, the bank said that it doesn’t impose any specific technology within its newly announced CBDC experiment program.As such, French central bank will select a maximum of 10 CBDC-related applications by groups or individuals, establishing “innovative nature” as a major selection criterion. According to a detailed document calling for applications, applications must be submitted by European Union-based applicants or in a state party to the European Economic Area agreement. Applicants can submit until May 15, 2020, while selection of applications will take place on July 10, the bank announced.Three use cases to be exploredThe bank’s CBDC experiment has three objectives such as modeling as CBDC-based interbank settlement and identifying benefits and analyzing the potential risks. Among three potential CBDC use cases, the Bank of France outlines payment against financial instruments, payment against other central banks’ digital currency and payment against digital assets.The bank emphasized that it will not engage in money creation within its CBDC experiment. Additionally, the central bank noted that it will be destroying the token reflecting the amount in euros in digital form at the end of the accounting day on which payment was made.The Bank of France also highlighted that it doesn’t plan to apply any project on a wider scale, stating:“These experiments will act as a contribution by the Banque de France to a broader discussion within the Eurosystem, which will make any decision on whether to set up a CBDC. The tests are not intended to be continued on a long-term basis or applied on a wide scale by the Banque de France itself.”Bank of France purportedly wanted to launch a CBDC by Q2 2020The new CBDC project from the central bank of France apparently marks the first time when the bank talked about CBDC since December 2019. On Dec. 4, the bank’s governor François Villeroy de Galhau reportedly announced that the bank will start testing the digital euro project by the end of the first quarter 2020. Previously, Denis Beau, the first deputy governor of Banque de France pointed out that blockchain technology could facilitate a number of financial and payment processes including cross-currency settlement.In early March, France’s markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, proposed a regulatory sandbox to experiment and explore potential benefits of security tokens within the European Union."
42218, HIVE Blockchain Acquires Bitcoin Mining Facility for $2.8M ,2020-03-30t20:32:00+01:00,3460,130,"HIVE Blockchain Technologies, a Canadian publicly-traded ether (ETH) mining firm, has announced on March 30 the acquisition of a dedicated cryptocurrency mining operation with access to 30 megawatts of low-cost green power.The transaction was valued at CAD $4 million (USD $2.8 M). The facility, leased by Cryptologic Corp, is located in Lachute, Quebec.The firm intends to expand its total available power capacity globally to approximately 50MW, whose mining activities in Europe are focused on the Ethereum network, while Bitcoin miners will be supported in Quebec’s facility.Giving priority to the green powerAccording to Frank Holmes, interim executive chairman of HIVE:“The acquisition provides us with an advanced, operating Bitcoin mining facility ready to transition to next generation mining hardware with access to some of the lowest cost electricity on the planet. The cost of US$95,000 per MW is less than half the industry standard build cost per MW.”HIVE hopes to add flexibility for future expansion plans. The firm already has a presence in Sweden.As detailed by the Canadian firm, the facility offers about $0.04 / kWh in electricity costs, and the electrical infrastructure expects to provide triple redundancy systems for power and internet connectivity, operational staff, and approximately 14,000 Bitmain S9 miners that are currently installed.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Holmes highlighted some reasons behind expanding into Quebec:“A blend of factors makes Quebec a very attractive location for us: geographical diversification, competitive green energy costs, the cost of skilled labor and VAT costs. The acquisition provides us direct control of our destiny, including significant capacity for expansion and flexibility for our future operations. And of course, the positive outlook for blockchain adoption is a reason for our expansion.”HIVE’s interim executive chairman clarifies that the facility operatesentirely onrenewable hydroelectricity, thus maintaining 100% green energy. Also, he added that their GPU-based resources provide flexibility to identify and focus computing resources on existing and new cryptocurrencies as they become more profitable to mine.Ether mining expansion in SwedenThe news comes after HIVE Blockchain Technologies announced on March 6, the two-phase expansion of its Ether mining operations by more than 20% at the company’s facility in Sweden.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Holmes commented on the company’s intentions to improve the profitability of the Iceland facility, as they have done in Sweden."
42213, Fake Trading Volumes and the Price of Bitcoin: Are They Connected? ,2020-03-30t20:02:00+01:00,4358,95,"Last year, Bitwise Asset Management reported to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of trading volume in Bitcoin (BTC) was fake. Bitwise found that, according to data published by CoinMarketCap — a widely cited tracker of crypto statistics — Bitcoin’s approximate average daily volume in April 2019 was $10 billion. In comparison, just $5.5 billion worth of Apple stock — the most liquid stock in the world — trades daily, and the market cap of Apple stock is nine times the size of Bitcoin’s.Related: Data Transparency and Fake Trading Volumes — Institutionalizing CryptoThe Blockchain Transparency Institute has been investigating fake volume in crypto markets since 2018. Its April 2019 report suggested that 17 of the 25 largest exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap had more than 99% fake volume. The most recent report from September 2019 showed “wash trading rates at high levels from 96.9% up to 99.7%.”As recently as 2019, the exchanges reporting the most volume were in some cases unheard of. According to Bitwise’s research, the largest reported exchange from April 2019, FCoin, declared $1.7 billion in daily trading volume, despite at the time having just 4,781 followers on Twitter. It had been mentioned only four times on Bloomberg, all in the context of fake trading volume, and the marketing tool Alexa ranked it as having the 56,539th largest website globally.The Bitwise study ranked Binance as the largest exchange with real volume, though it ranked 15th overall when those reporting fake volumes were included. During April 2019, Binance reported $218 million in daily trading volume — 1/7th that of FCoin — despite being mentioned 6,830 times by Bloomberg, its CEO being followed by 342,000 people on Twitter, and having a website that ranked 971th in the world, according to Alexa.The Bitcoin market is steadily maturing, to be sure, and today’s Bitcoin market is not like it was in the past. Many first-generation pillars of the Bitcoin ecosystem were started by first-time entrepreneurs who were simply interested in Bitcoin. Mt. Gox, the beleaguered, Japan-based Bitcoin exchange, was once a site for trading Magic: The Gathering cards. CoinMarketCap, the most popular data aggregator in the space, was started in 2013 as a part-time project run out of an apartment.Related: Mt. Gox Casts a Dark Shadow of Crypto’s Collapse — A Long Fight for JusticeToday, the best-known crypto exchanges are large enterprises operating in a maturing ecosystem. Regulated Bitcoin futures, the development of institutional short lending, large algorithmic market makers, Bitcoin custody and custodial insurance have added to the efficiency of the market. Despite Bitcoin’s faked volume, and a spot market smaller than commonly thought, its price is more accurately determined every day.Bitcoin spot prices, as well as other larger-cap cryptocurrencies, are considered accurate, thanks to an established global market for Bitcoin trading and the prevalence of exchanges around the world. What’s more, traditional data aggregators — think Nasdaq, the Intercontinental Exchange, Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters — are entering the industry, which will give us only a clearer picture of the data that affects Bitcoin trading.Internet attention and the price of BitcoinResearchers from the University of Cagliari in Italy used Google Trends, which illustrates how frequently a fixed term is looked up, to study the interplay between Bitcoin and Google’s search engine. They specifically researched the relationship between Bitcoin’s trading volumes and the volume of Bitcoin-related search queries made using Google.In a report titled “The Predictor Impact of Web Search Media on Bitcoin Trading Volumes,” the researchers found “significant cross correlation values, demonstrating search volumes power to anticipate trading volumes of Bitcoin currency.”The researchers studied the period between June 2014 and July 2015 and compared Bitcoin trading behavior with data on search queries obtained from Google Trends. The report concluded:“We can afﬁrm that Google Trends is a good predictor, because of its high cross correlation value. Our results conﬁrm those found in previous works, based on a different corpus and referred to a different Bitcoin market trend. As future advancement, we are thinking about the possibility to apply this kind of approach to different contexts in order to better understand the predictive power of web search media. An other likelihood could be to consider not only search media but also social media like Twitter, Facebook and Google+.”As trading both digital assets and more traditional stocks and commodities become progressively digitized, online mentions will likely play a key role in determining and predicting the sentiment of various markets, not just cryptocurrency.Crypto has “no exposure” to stocks and macroeconomicsIn a 2018 report titled “Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrency,” researchers Yukun Liu and Aleh Tsyvinski from Yale University found that the risk–return tradeoff of Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and XRP differs from those seen in stocks, fiat currencies and precious metals. “Cryptocurrencies have no exposure to most common stock market and macroeconomic factors,” they wrote. “They also have no exposure to the returns of currencies and commodities.”The authors concluded that cryptocurrency returns can only be predicted by aspects specific to crypto:“Specifically, we determine that there is a strong time-series momentum effect and that proxies for investor attention strongly forecast cryptocurrency returns.”In short, cryptocurrency returns have little exposure to traditional asset classes, such as stocks, fiat currencies and commodities.The researchers determined that cryptocurrency returns are predicted by two factors: momentum and investor attention.“Our findings call into question popular explanations that supply factors such as mining costs, price-to-‘dividend’ ratio, or realized volatility are useful for predicting the behavior of cryptocurrency returns.”How is Bitcoin trading regulated?When trading Bitcoin, knowing the rules and regulations is essential. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service declared in 2014 that Bitcoin was property, not currency. Any profits made from Bitcoin investing and trading, therefore, would be taxed at each investor’s capital gains rate, not an ordinary income rate.In July 2019, the IRS sent letters to 10,000 digital-currency holders who failed to pay taxes or properly report taxes on digital assets. IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig stated:“Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest and penalties.”Altcoins and having a planThere are other things to keep in mind when trading. Before trading a specific digital asset, especially those considered altcoins, investigate its trading volume. If you’re considering trading a more obscure altcoin, then you should learn how many such tokens are being bought and sold daily.The higher the trading volume, the easier it will be to buy and sell the digital asset. Low trading volume, on the other hand, suggests a lower level of liquidity; that is, a trader could struggle to buy or sell the digital asset on the open market. Crypto exchanges have even delisted tokens with dubious or declining trade volumes.Having a plan for every trade can help ensure you don’t make a knee-jerk reaction in a fit of emotion-based trading. Disciplined investors and traders draft a game plan for the prices at which they intend to buy and sell an asset and don’t deviate from this plan. In order to manage this, traders can use stop-loss orders, which ensure an asset is sold at a predetermined price.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

42211," The Law Is Coming for Bitcoin, Warns Satoshi Claimant Craig Wright ",2020-03-30t19:57:00+01:00,32053,204,"The man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto says 2020 is the year the law comes for Bitcoin. Writing on his personal blog, Craig Wright offered a view of Bitcoin’s future which doesn’t bode well for operators of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, or the coin’s miners.One of Bitcoin’s biggest attractions is its supposedly permissionless, authority-resistant nature. But according to Wright, these are illusions.Wright claims that any amount of Bitcoin purchased without meeting legally recognized CDD (customer due diligence) and KYC (know your customer) requirements is, in effect, stolen Bitcoin.According to Wright, that spells trouble for Lightning Network operators who receive such ‘stolen’ Bitcoin:“Lightning is about creating a system that is not built on individual tokens, but rather balances, because they are treated very differently under law. Yet, the Lightning Network cannot work without Bitcoin tokens as the initial seed base. Here lies the greatest flaw of the system.”Wright claims the Lightning Network’s system of symbols and balances won’t shield it from legal investigation and enforcement.“If stolen bitcoin are passed into a Lightning channel, the purchaser in the Lightning channel does not gain good title. Equivalently, the civil rule of nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse habet, or, ‘one cannot transfer to another more rights than he has’, means that it does not matter whether you send bitcoin to a Lightning channel; if the bitcoin are stolen, they cannot be transferred.”Wright also cites the legal principle of Nemo dat quod non habet - or, “no one can give what they don’t have.” If the legal rights to the ‘stolen’ coins are not transferred legally, then in Wright’s view, this would leave the Lightning Network open to the threat of a court-sanctioned freezing order.Going further still, Wright reiterates another ominous scenario for Bitcoin miners. Namely, that any miner who receives or mines ‘stolen’ Bitcoin can be pursued by authorities under a nation’s standard theft laws.Wright cites a section of the UK’s Theft Act (1968) which covers the handling of stolen goods - a charge that comes with a 14 year maximum prison sentence in the United Kingdom.“A person handles stolen goods if (otherwise than in the course of the stealing) knowing or believing them to be stolen goods he dishonestly receives the goods, or dishonestly undertakes or assists in their retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or if he arranges to do so.”Craig Wright’s prognostications are based on his assumption that Bitcoin is stolen if not purchased under the purview of CDD and KYC laws. At the moment, no such enforcement of ownership laws surrounding Bitcoin actually exists.Attorney at law, Preston J. Byrne, notes that Wright’s scenario doesn’t play out unless a universally agreed upon ‘blacklist’ of stolen coins were available for all to see. Byrne says:“If there were a central register of stolen BTC established by law of which every BTC purchaser in a given jurisdiction was deemed to have constructive notice of these claims, notice could be imputed if any party failed to check that register and then accepted payment in blacklisted coins.”As Byrne points out, no such register currently exists. The law may very well come to meet Bitcoin one day, but will it be under the circumstances that Craig Wright suggests?"

This shows that with all the money being printed to support the economy, a tiny bit might be finding its way into the crypto space, which is a huge positive.Over the long-term, only a fraction of the total stimulus packages announced around the world are enough to boost the crypto market capitalization.While many are bullish in the long-term, several investors want to catch the bottom. Earlier in the year veteran trader Tone Vays forecast that Bitcoin could bottom out closer to $2,800, but now he believes that the bottom might have been formed around $3,700. Vays does not expect Bitcoin to dip below the recent lows.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360As traders, our focus is the price action. However, during these difficult times, it is heartening to see that various agencies and nations are taking the help of blockchain technology to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Along with helping with the technology part, we are very happy to note that the global crypto community has come together and is also doing its bit to help during this time of crisis.The current crypto recovery is being led by Bitcoin as its dominance rate closes in on 66%. This raises the question of whether cryptocurrencies sustain the current relief rally and start a sustained uptrend? Let’s analyze the charts.BTC/USDThe failure of the bulls to propel Bitcoin (BTC) above the overhead resistance of $7,000 attracted selling. That dragged the price below the immediate support of $6,435 but the bears could not break the next support of $5,660.47. This is a positive sign as it shows demand at lower levels.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the bulls are again attempting to carry the price above $6,435 and the 20-day EMA at $6,520. If successful, a retest of $7,000 is possible. Above this level, a move to the 50-day SMA at $7,985 and above it to $9,000 is likely.Contrary to our assumption, if the BTC/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA and slides below the support at $5,660.47, a drop to the long-term support line at $5,000 is possible. For now, the traders can protect their long positions with stops at $5,600.ETH/USDEther (ETH) continues to trade between the $117.090-$155.612 range. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewA break below the range can sink the ETH/USD pair to $100 and below it to $84.250. However, if the pair bounces off the support of the range, a few more days of consolidation is likely.The pair will pick up momentum on a break above $155.612. Above this level, a move to the 50-day SMA at $198 is possible. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.XRP/USDThe failure of the bulls to sustain XRP above $0.17468 attracted selling. The bears attempted to resume the down move on March 29 but the bulls provided support close to $0.16 levels.XRP USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls can propel the price above $0.17468 once again and sustain the level, the XRP/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum. The first target to watch on the upside is $0.22 and above it $0.25.Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from $0.17468 once again, the bears will try to sink it to $0.1275. Hence, the stop loss on the long positions can be retained at $0.143 for now. We shall suggest trailing the stop to $0.16 after the pair rises above $0.19.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 20-day EMA on March 27 but the buyers stepped in just above the immediate support at $197.43. This is a positive sign as it shows demand on dips.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe bulls will now try to drive the price above the 20-day EMA at $227 and the horizontal resistance at $247.95. If successful, the BCH/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to the 50-day SMA at $304 and above it to $350.Hence, the traders can buy above $250 and keep a stop loss below $197. Our view will be invalidated if the pair plummets below $197.43. In such a case, a drop to $166 is likely.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) turned down from the 20-day EMA on March 27. However, the bulls held the strong support at $146.96, which shows buying on dips. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a range formation for the next few days.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWe now anticipate the bulls to carry the BSV/USD pair to the overhead resistance at $185.87. If the price turns down from this level, the pair will extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.A break above $185.87 will indicate strength. Above this level, a move to the 50-day SMA at $223 and above it to $260 is possible.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $146.96, a drop to $120 is likely. Therefore, the stop loss on the long positions can be kept at $146.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA at $42.14 on March 27. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears. A drop below $35.8582 can drag the price to $30.LTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the LTC/USD pair is attempting to rebound off the support at $35.8582. If the bulls can carry the price above the 20-day EMA at $41.12 and the horizontal resistance of $43.67, the pair is likely to pick up momentum.The first target to watch on the upside is the 50-day SMA at $55.63. If this level is crossed, the up move can reach $63.8769. The traders can initiate long positions as suggested by us in an earlier analysis.EOS/USDEOS has been trading inside a tight range of $2.0632-$2.4001 since March 21. This shows that both the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are not taking any large bets. The 20-day EMA continues to slope down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.EOS USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewHowever, the bears have not been able to sink the EOS/USD pair below $2.0632, which shows a lack of sellers at lower levels.If the bulls can propel the pair above the overhead resistance at $2.4001, a rally to the 50-day SMA at $3.32 and above it to $3.86 is possible. As the risk to reward ratio is attractive, we have retained the buy suggested in our earlier analysis.BNB/USDBinance Coin (BNB) turned down from the 20-day EMA at $13.27 on March 27. Though the bears were able to sink the price below the immediate support at $12.1111, they could not break below the next support at $10.8428.BNB USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThis shows that the buyers are keen to enter at lower levels. Currently, the bulls are again attempting to push the BNB/USD pair above $12.1111. If successful, the bulls will make one more attempt to climb above the 20-day EMA at $12.91. If successful, a move to the downtrend line at $15 is possible.On the other hand, if the pair reverses direction from the 20-day EMA once again, the possibility of a break below $10.8428 increases. Below this level, a drop to $8.4422 is likely. Currently, we do not find any reliable buy setups, hence, we remain neutral on the pair.XTZ/USDTezos (XTZ) broke below the trendline of the ascending triangle, which invalidates the pattern. A breakdown of a bullish pattern is a bearish sign. Currently, the altcoin is attempting a bounce off the immediate support at $1.4453.XTZ USD daily chart.

The pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above the 20-day EMA at $1.77 and the overhead resistance at $1.955.Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis. The pair will turn negative if the price turns down from the trendline and plummets below $1.4453.LEO/USDAfter consolidating between the $1-$1.04 range for the past few days, UNUS SED LEO (LEO) has broken out of $1.04. This is a positive sign. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls.LEO USD daily chart.

42202, Riot Blockchain Cites COVID-19 Disruption Risks on SEC Form 10-K ,2020-03-30t18:13:00+01:00,2595,80,"Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency mining firm, Riot Blockchain, filed its Form 10-K annual report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), March 25.Among a long list of other potential risk factors to the business, the report assesses the potential disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 will affect cryptocurrency mining businessAs part of the Form 10-K a company must include information about any significant risks to its business. Riot further subdivides these risks into several sections, although interestingly lists the risks from COVID-19 as a cryptocurrency-related risk, rather than a general risk:“Our business will be adversely impacted by the effects of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and any other related adverse public health developments will cause disruption to the activities of our international suppliers and, potentially, our mining activities.”The report goes on to state that the company already has and will experience further disruptions to operations, due to quarantines, self isolation and other restrictions of movement, preventing employees from performing their jobs.According to the report, Riot has six full-time employees, with activities relying on three consultants to manage and maintain mining rigs.Biggest risk to third-party supply chainWhile the risk of the new coronavirus to six employees and a warehouse full of Antminers may be limited, the effect on third-party offices and factories, border closures and supply chains could prove more drastic.Riot cites the fact that replacements for obsolete mining rigs or spare parts to repair existing machines may no longer be available. However, as Cointelegraph reported, the company recently received 4,000 new S17 Antminer Pro machines, initially ordered at the end of last year.Finally, the report states that a wider lockdown, including mandatory business closures, would adversely affect operations. Regulators have not designated cryptocurrency an essential industry.Lowering expectations in advance?COVID-19 is by far not the only risk cited by Riot in its annual report. In fact a full 18 pages of the 48-page document is devoted to risk factors.The report also notes that the company is not profitable and has incurred losses since inception. It expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future, which may increase as the company develops its business. Mining costs currently outpace mining revenues.The report also cites previous failures of the company in the animal health and life-sciences industries, and suggests that there is no guarantee that its pivot to a cryptocurrency mining strategy will be any more successful.Riot was one of a number of companies who took advantage of the cryptocurrency boom in 2017, by changing its name to include the word ‘blockchain’ to see its share price rocket from $8 to over $40.It has since made cryptocurrency mining its core business, although it also launched a cryptocurrency exchange in 2019, which it has since given up on."
42200, Jack Dorsey Wants Cash App to Distribute US Stimulus Package ,2020-03-30t17:54:00+01:00,4173,217,"The founder and CEO of Square Inc, Jack Dorsey, believes that his company’s crypto-friendly payments application Cash App can distribute America’s stimulus package more efficiently than the U.S. government.On March 27, Dorsey responded to the tweet of a Cash App user suggesting that the payments application could be used to distribute the United States’ forthcoming $2 trillion stimulus package.Square contacts U.S. Treasury regarding stimulus distribution“People need help immediately,” Dorsey posted. “The technology exists to get money to most people today (even to those without bank accounts). Square and many of our peers can get it done. US government: let us help.”According to anonymous sources cited by CNN Business on March 27, both Cash App and fellow payments platform Venmo have reached out to the U.S. Treasury to discuss how they can assist in disbursing the funds.Distributing stimulus through banking system risks neglecting the unbankedSpeaking to Cointelegraph earlier this month, Catherine Coley, the CEO of Binance.US, warned that by using existing means of payment to distribute the stimulus package, the U.S. government may “neglect” those who lack access to financial services.Coley warned that “the existing rails oftentimes neglect those that may not have bank accounts or may not be able to go and visit their brick and mortar bank in times like these crises.”Electronic Transactions Association argues payment platforms can mitigate COVID-19 risksOn March 19, Jodie Kelley, the CEO of the trade body representing payments companies, the Electronic Transactions Association penned a letter to the Whitehouse warning of the impracticalities and risks associated with using the banking system to distribute the stimulus:“Many Americans do not have a bank account at a traditional financial institution. Upon receipt of a stimulus check, they would need to rely on expensive cash checking services to access their money.”The letter added that using “electronic payments options helps Americans reduce the chance of exposure to the virus by avoiding handling cash,” adding that digital distribution will also help maintain social distancing measures."
42195, The Need to Report Carbon Emissions Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic ,2020-03-30t15:56:00+01:00,2398,102,"JPMorgan Chase, the first American bank to create and successfully test a digital coin representing a fiat currency, also provided the most fossil fuel financing out of any bank in the world, according to a 2019 report titled “Banking on Climate Change.” The bank recently joined a chorus of other financial institutions and endowments that have declared that they will, going forward, be reluctant to provide funding to the fossil fuel industry — which energizes emerging digital technologies and companies — in order to mitigate the effects of climate change.In a hard-hitting report released to clients on the same day as the World Health Organization published its 32nd coronavirus update, economists at JPMorgan Chase warned that human life ""as we know it"" could be threatened by climate change. Without action being taken, there could be ""catastrophic outcomes.""Carbon pollution defies national borders and is inescapable. The true cost of climate change is felt when it penetrates deep into our respiratory and circulatory systems and damages our lungs, which are highly vulnerable to the coronavirus, according to a report prepared by the WHO. The economists at JPMorgan Chase state that “climate change could affect economic growth, shares, health and how long people live.”In order to mitigate the effects of climate change, there needs to be a global tax on carbon, the report added. This stance echoes that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has said that greater reliance on environmental taxation is needed to strengthen global efforts to tackle the principal source of both greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution, particularly since society is now witnessing the implementation of digital currencies, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology worldwide. These new digital technologies require very high consumptions of electricity, which is currently produced with coal and fossil fuels that have adverse environmental impacts.Global environmental tax policyEnvironmental tax is used as an economic instrument to address environmental problems by taxing activities that burden the environment — like a direct carbon tax — or by providing incentives to lessen environmental burdens and preserve environmental activities — like tax credits or subsidies. It’s used as part of a market-based climate policy that was pioneered in the United States, which also includes cap-and-trade programs that attempt to limit emissions by putting a cap and price on them.Environmental taxes are designed to internalize environmental costs and provide economic incentives for people and businesses to promote ecologically sustainable activities, such as reducing carbon emissions, promoting green growth and fighting climate change through innovation. Some governments make use of them to integrate climate and environmental costs into prices to reduce excessive emissions while also raising revenue to fund vital government services.The top six global carbon emitters are: China, the U.S., the European Union, India, Russia and Japan. Their taxes on carbon emissions and subsidies for fossil fuels are as follows:Carbon taxUnder a carbon tax regime, the government sets a price that carbon emitters must pay for each ton of greenhouse gases they emit. This encourages businesses and consumers to take the necessary steps, such as switching fuels or adopting new technologies, to reduce their emissions and avoid paying the tax. These taxes are favored because assigning a fee to carbon pollution is administratively simple when compared to addressing climate change by setting, monitoring and enforcing caps on greenhouse gas emissions and regulating emissions of the energy-generation sector. Environmental taxes include energy taxes, transport taxes, pollution taxes and resources taxes.According to the OECD, outside of road transport, 81% of carbon emissions are untaxed, and tax rates are below the low-end estimate of climate costs for 97% of emissions. Coal, which is characterized by high levels of harmful emissions and accounts for almost half of carbon emissions from energy use in the 42 countries examined by the OECD, is taxed at the lowest rates or goes untaxed. Only 40 out of the 197 governments that have signed on to the first legally binding climate change agreement — the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s 2015 Paris Agreement — have adopted some sort of price on hydrocarbons, either through direct taxes on fossil fuels or through cap-and-trade programs.Carbon taxes have been implemented in 29 of the jurisdictions that have signed on to the Paris Agreement. A Scandinavian wave starting in the early 1990s saw carbon taxes legislated in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, among other countries. A second wave in the mid-2000s saw carbon taxes put in place in Switzerland, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Portugal and the United Kingdom. In 2019, Canada, Argentina, South Africa and Singapore implemented a carbon tax. These tax rates range from $1 to $139 per ton.According to the World Bank’s “Report of the High-Level Commission of Carbon Prices,” a carbon price/tax of between $50 to $100 per ton of carbon emissions would need to be implemented by signatories to deliver on Paris-Agreement commitments by 2030.Tax creditsThrough tax credits, subsidies and other business incentives, governments can encourage companies to engage in behaviors and develop technologies, including blockchain, that can reduce carbon emissions. These credits could combat the use of fossil fuels. For example, a new study by the Overseas Development Institute titled “G20 Coal Subsidies: Tracking Government Support to a Fading Industry” suggests that coal subsidies have increased threefold since the Paris Agreement, even though it commits its signatories to hold global warming to well below two degrees Celsius through significant greenhouse emission cuts.According to the International Monetary Fund, as well as the International Energy Agency, the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies worldwide would be one of the most effective ways of reducing greenhouse gases and battling global warming.For example, Saudi Arabia has the world’s second-largest oil reserves that sustain 90% of its total public revenues, and is the primary swing oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. According to a study on the country, its energy subsidies in 2012 were $80 billion, representing 11% of the country's gross domestic product. Saudi Arabia has undertaken blockchain-oriented national projects aimed at diversifying and modernizing its economy by backing numerous financial-technology initiatives, including the world’s first state-backed bilateral cryptocurrency with the United Arab Emirates called “Aber,” which is Arabic for passing by, crossing or traveling on a road.Paris Agreement climate change advocatesThe urgency to wean off fossil fuels as a major energy source, given its negative consequences to the world's climate and human life — which has recently been forced into a digital quarantine lifestyle — wasn’t only written in the reports by the OECD and JPMorgan Chase, however. There have been many other climate change advocates penning action.An op-ed jointly written by the heads of the Bank of England, which is seriously weighing the pros and cons of issuing a central bank digital currency denominated in pounds sterling, and pf France’s central bank, which plans to test plans a central bank digital currency for financial institutions this year, said that any company that does not change strategically to the new energy reality “will fail to exist.”In an open letter, the founder and CEO of investment giant BlackRock — which is setting up a working group to evaluate its potential involvement in the Bitcoin (BTC) market, including investments in Bitcoin futures — said that “climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects.” And, investment advisors who manage nearly half the world's invested capital, amounting to more than $34 trillion in assets, urged G-20 countries to comply with the Paris Agreement to save the global economy $160 trillion. They pointed to the alternative, which is that noncompliance would result in damages of $54 trillion.In a landmark German class-action lawsuit, hundreds of thousands of diesel car owners sought compensation over emissions test cheating from Volkswagen, a company in which digitalization impacts all areas of business: development, vehicle production and the entire work environment on the shop floor and in the office.In the biggest settlement of its kind, the Brazilian oil company Petróleo Brasileiro — commonly referred to as Petrobras — settled a U.S. class-action lawsuit for $2.95 billion that resulted from the “Operation Car Wash” money-laundering investigation. A memo from the settlement stated that the company made materially false, misleading statements to U.S. investors about climate-related bribery, branding and lobbying payments — potentially also using cryptocurrencies — to politicians that were designed to control, delay or block binding climate-motivated policies in various countries, hindering the implementation of green-energy policies in the wake of the Paris Agreement.In another class-action lawsuit, 17,000 Dutch citizens tried to stop Royal Dutch Shell from extracting oil and gas and force it to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050. The company is in talks with a subsidiary of the Chinese oil and chemical giant Sinochem Group and Australian financial-services firm Macquarie Group to develop a blockchain platform, with the goal of reducing trade and settlement inefficiencies, improving transparency and reducing the risk of fraud in the oil industry.A landmark legal opinion from the Dutch Supreme Court stated that the Dutch government, which has an upbeat blockchain and crypto action agenda, has explicit duties to protect citizens’ human rights in the face of climate change and must reduce emissions by at least 25% of 1990 levels by the end of 2020.An article by a pioneering proteomics scientist said: “The need to dramatically reduce global emissions is a black swan moment that investors need to pay attention to” because of the significant near-term threat from climate change activism toward the top four global fossil fuel businesses — Exxon Mobil, Chevron, British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell, all of which recently formed a global blockchain consortium — that are behind more than 10% of the world’s carbon emissions since 1965, according to a recent report.The writing has been on the wall for the oil markets for quite some time, given that fossil fuel energy was the worst-performing sector on the S&P 500 index in 2019. In 1980, the energy industry represented 28% of the index’s value, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Last year, it represented less than 5%. The shift away from oil loomed so large that Moody’s warned in 2018 that the energy transition represented “significant business and credit risk” for oil companies. Accordingly, on March 8, Saudi Arabia announced oil price cuts and plans to increase oil production after expanding its downstream oil operations by acquiring Royal Dutch Shell’s 50% stake in their refining joint venture Saudi Aramco Shell Refinery Company, referred to as SASREF, for $631 million.This kick-started a global oil price war sending prices, along with world stock market prices and crypto prices — which showed minute-by-minute correlation with the stock market, negating its status as an uncorrelated investment asset — into a free fall that spiraled into a bear market at the fastest rate in history. The resulting global economic downturn has been unprecedented. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is seen as the benchmark index to gauge the health of the global economy, declined by 38% during mid-March before seeing a moderate recovery. This has been its worst month in 90 years and has been emblematic of those incurred during major recessions.The magnitude of the stock and bond value losses that major corporations — 100 of which have been identified as being accountable for more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions — have sustained as a result of the ongoing global economic decline have been extraordinary, as they have occurred concurrently with the rapid, global spread of the lethal coronavirus in a border-blind fashion. This has led to lockdowns of countries and shutdowns of businesses, sending millions of out-of-work people to the unemployment lines, cut off from health care plans, and with a severe loss of pension and retirement plan assets.Corporate internal carbon pricingPublic companies are generally required to disclose material information in their financial filings, including climate and related bribery, branding, and lobbying payments. Directors of these public companies are generally required to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, and to consider and manage material risks to a company’s business.Shareholders are allowed to challenge companies and/or boards of directors for failure to do so under Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act, which gives shareholders the right to file a lawsuit to recover economic losses sustained as a result of fraud related to the trading of their investments in stocks, bonds, tokens or initial coin offerings. As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has stated, tokens and ICOs that feature and market the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law.Fraud can come in many forms: corporate misgovernance through tax evasion; a lack of effective internal controls over corruption prevention involving bribery, lobbying, bid-rigging and money laundering; or poor financial recordkeeping, including statements regarding future environmental liabilities and climate change impacts.Companies are coming under growing pressure from shareholders, activists and investment advisors who want companies to be transparent about how the physical impacts of a changing climate will affect their business. They are bringing class-action lawsuits based on climate change.Originally a uniquely American undertaking, and historically prohibited in most other countries, class-action lawsuits have ramped up and spread across 33 countries. As of January, the total number of climate change cases filed thus far has reached approximately 1,444, with some success.The threat of multi-jurisdictional class-action lawsuits stemming from environmental liabilities motivated nearly 1,400 public- and private-sector organizations — including global financial firms responsible for assets in excess of $118 trillion — to support the work of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which has aligned with the Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing issued by the United Nations Global Compact’s Caring for Climate initiative. Internal carbon pricing has emerged as an important tool to help companies manage climate risks and identify opportunities in the low-carbon economy transition.In the past two years, there has been a particularly strong increase in corporate internal carbon-pricing initiatives in China, Japan, Mexico and the U.S. Studies estimate that the financial value at risk could be up to 17% of global financial assets, if not more. Digital companies, including crypto mining companies, that haven’t yet adopted an internal price/tax will soon have to do so as investors demand more and more insight into the risks of climate disruption, according to a report prepared by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.Country-by-country reporting schemeMultinational enterprises in 90 countries, which include crypto exchanges and crypto mining companies, also adhere to country-by-country reporting policies as a part of a tax-transparency initiative included in OECD’s “Inclusive Framework on BEPS” — BEPS being an acronym for “base erosion and profit shifting.”Country-by-country reporting, or CBCR, requires tax administrations to collect and share with other tax administrations information about multinational enterprises that operate in their countries, including MNE group revenue, profit before tax and tax accrued. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued further nonbinding guidance in a practice aid on how to account for cryptocurrencies.The goal is to give tax offices the information needed to assess if there is a risk that an MNE group is avoiding taxes through inappropriate transfer pricing or other means.In the OECD’s March 6 CBCR-related public consultation, 21 of the 78 respondents requested that the OECD revise BEPS framework to adopt the first global standard on public tax disclosure, published in December 2019 by the Global Reporting Initiative, that brings tax transparency to thousands of MNEs by making CBCR disclosures publicly available.One notable submission, signed by 33 U.S. Congresspeople, endorsed the GRI’s new CBCR standard by calling on the OECD to ensure CBCR reporting is “aligned with the GRI.” Meanwhile, members of the U.S. House of Representatives have introduced a tax-transparency bill that would require MNEs to publicly disclose key tax and financial information on a country-by-country basis.The OECD’s scheduled second CBCR public consultation on March 17 was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.ConclusionOne-third of the world’s population is now locked down in order to mitigate the global spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which has already infected over 500,000 people and brings in its wake great losses in health and finance. This has led to a new quarantine lifestyle that necessitates increased digital social and business interaction. Even climate change protesters — who have swarmed the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, the United Nations Climate Conference, and the headquarters of Royal Dutch Shell — are holding digital climate change protest meetings via Twitter.Digital technologies require a high consumption of electricity, which is currently mostly produced with fossil fuels that adversely impact the environment.

42194, New Exchange on ‘Mission to Connect Crypto to Global Finance’ ,2020-03-30t15:47:00+01:00,2127,18,"A new exchange says it is determined to expand the crypto market, opening doors to traders who want to buy and sell traditional financial instruments, all while giving institutional traders access to digital assets.AAX launched in November 2019 with “a mission to connect crypto to global finance.” To this end, it plans to offer tokenized commodities and indexes, as well as social trading programs and security tokens. It is the first cryptocurrency exchange to be powered by LSEG Technology, which provides infrastructure to the London Stock Exchange Group.Thor Chan, AAX’s CEO, thinks the crypto industry is at a pivotal moment right now. Times have changed since late 2017, when the sector had a market cap of $800 billion and startups could raise millions in a matter of minutes. However, he believes tokenization offers an irresistible opportunity to tap into gold markets worth $8 trillion, not to mention global stock markets valued at $80 trillion.With the Bitcoin halving scheduled to happen just around the corner in May, Chan said: “AAX is confident that the crypto industry has the potential to grow at least a hundredfold, reaching into the trillions, and find its rightful place in global finance.”“When crypto goes mainstream, we’re ready”AAX offers spot, futures and over-the-counter trading. It quotes more than 50 cryptocurrency pairs and lists perpetual futures contracts for five major coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), XRP and EOS. These can be traded with up to 100 times leverage.In terms of user experience, AAX says it provides a “secure, deeply liquid, ultra-low latency and fully compliant trading platform.” According to the company, its infrastructure boasts a scalable matching engine with “market-leading performance and reliability” that runs on the same code base powering stock markets in London, Milan and Oslo. As a result, AAX notes it is confident that its systems can handle institutional order volumes that are on par with capital global markets.AAX is available hereAAX claims that most orders are processed in under 800 microseconds, making it faster “than any crypto exchange out there.” Its estimates suggest that its matching engine can scale up to 1 million transactions per second, meaning it won’t suffer capacity concerns when cryptocurrencies begin to enjoy mainstream acceptance.A more sensible industryChan said that the heady days of the 2017 bull run were unsustainable and could not last forever, but added that the industry is “more sensible and professional” than it was before. Regulation is providing higher levels of consumer protection, and tokenization increasingly means “investment classes primarily accessible to financial elites with large amounts of capital will gradually become more open to retail investors.”He added: “We see two movements that stand at the point of convergence. On the one hand, institutional investors are increasingly getting involved in the crypto space. On the other hand, digital asset innovation is making traditional asset classes more accessible to the mainstream.”AAX revealed its plan to list its first commodity finance token, Phigold, on March 31. “It provides a real-world example of how blockchain technology can be leveraged to disrupt a well-established industry: gold investment,” the team noted.Moreover, AAX has also announced that it is launching a native exchange token known as AAB that delivers discounts on all spot and futures trades and unlocks exclusive services, such as trading bots and trading signals.A total of 100 people now work for AAX across two offices in Asia and Europe. The company believes that it offers the secret ingredient that will help the crypto sector grow: sophisticated products that enable different types of engagement with the market.Learn more about AAXDisclaimer.

42193, Bitfinex DeFi Offshoot Burns $20M Tokens in Bid to Drive DEX Adoption ,2020-03-30t15:22:00+01:00,3123,79,"DeversiFi, the decentralized exchange (DEX) spin-off of former Bitfinex sister exchange Ethfinex, has burned $20 million worth of its governance and utility token, Nectar (NEC).According to a statement, March 30, this is designed to drive DEX adoption after large centralized exchanges struggled to cope during the recent cryptocurrency sell-off.Governance token switches to deflationary modelThe Nectar token was originally launched with an inflationary model, in which it was awarded to Ethfinex traders, giving them a stake in the future of the exchange.However, with Ethfinex’s pivot towards decentralization and rebirth as DeversiFi, the token has switched to a deflationary model. Since mid-February this has taken the form of weekly ‘necBurn’ auctions to perpetually reduce the supply.Up to 50% of trading fee revenue on DeversiFi is used to buy back and burn Nectar tokens in an auction format. Holders can offer their NEC at a certain price. If those tokens are bought they are permanently removed from the supply. Auctions can also result in a higher sell-price than on the open market, opening up a unique arbitrage opportunity.To symbolize and promote the move to a deflationary model, DiversiFi performed a ‘big-burn’ of 400 million Nectar tokens on March 27. These tokens were those initially held by Ethfinex and retained when the exchange closed down.Driving DEX adoptionAs Cointelegraph reported, Ethfinex first tested a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure back in June last year, in part to dissociate itself from Bitfinex, which was under investigation at the time over an alleged illegal loan from Tether.That eventually led to the closure of Ethfinex and subsequent launch of DeversiFi. DeversiFi in turn launched its ‘necDAO’ in December 2019, which now has 17,000 ETH locked in. The DAO began governance in January 2020.So how will the reduction in Nectar supply drive adoption of decentralized exchanges? Cointelegraph reached out to DeversiFi Founder and CEO, Will Harbourne:“Nectar has been designed to give holders/traders a number of benefits including trading fee discounts and membership in one of the largest DAO’s to date [...] This shift to aggressively deflationary tokenomics will serve to lower the market cap and increase the scarcity/value of Nectar. Coupled with the outlined utilities, this should create a positive feedback loop, helping to attract new traders to DeversiFi and the DEFI space as a whole.”Despite advantages over centralized exchanges, DEXs have still struggled to gain traction in the marketplace."
42192," Tron Launches Djed, a Platform That Looks Suspiciously Like MakerDAO ",2020-03-30t15:12:00+01:00,3512,72,"On March 28, Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun tweeted to announce the release of Djed, a system for collateralized loans he described as “something new.” The platform was immediately criticized as many see it as a plagiarized version of MakerDAO (MKR).Sun teased the launch on Jan. 16 when Sun let his fans choose the name of a planned decentralized stablecoin that was initially to be backed by TRX and BitTorrent Token (BTT).Self-described TRX whale and Tron fan Mike McCarthy was the one who proposed the name Djed, just one hour and a half after Sun’s initial tweet. The name is drawn from ancient Egypt and represents the concept of stability.“Borrowing” Dai’s conceptsThe Djed platform is live under the Tronscan.org domain, and shows an interface with similarities to several Maker-based websites, including Oasis.app, vote.makerdao.com, cdp.makerdao.com, among others.But while Djed’s interface is still reasonably modified, the system itself appears to be a clone of the old Single Collateral Dai for Maker. The principle is the same, though Tron users will be committing TRX collateral to mint USDJ, instead of Dai. The governance token is called JED, instead of MKR.Even without looking at the code, the platform resumes many of the terms used within Maker.Djed is a lending platform using Collateralized Debt Positions(CDP). Users must pay a Stability Fee as an interest rate on their loan, which is decided via an Executive Vote helped by assessments of Djed’s Interim Risk Team.All of these terms are used to describe MakerDAO features as well. Though these are superficial similarities, the smart contract code further nails down that Djed is a clone of Single Collateral Dai.While the source is unavailable, contract calls on Djed have the same names as Maker’s: SaiProxyCallAndExecute, DaiFab, MomFab, DadFab and many others.Crucially, the Sai name suggests that this is indeed the old version of Dai, as it was renamed to Sai after the introduction of multiple forms of collateral. It also would explain why Djed only allows TRX tokens for collateral, instead of the promised BTT.The Cointelegraph analytics team also identified several flaws with how the implementation interacts with Tron, which they believe were introduced to avoid changing Maker’s code as much as possible. They explained that Tron decided to maintain the requirement of wrapping the collateral before creating the pooled version of TRX, even though there is no need to do so for Tron, creating an additional crutch.”Furthermore, the analytics team believes that the use of a normal account to hold the “Tub” contract, described as “the engine of the CDPs,” makes the system very opaque.A history of plagiarismTron has often been accused of plagiarizing from other projects. Many allege that its original whitepaper was copy-pasted from Ethereum, which kicked off a negative perception of the project in many crypto circles.As reported by Cointelegraph, a recent privacy feature also included mostly unchanged Zcash (ZEC) code to handle at least some privacy aspects — notably, the trusted setup.However, it is worth noting that Djed is a project from Tronscan rather than the Tron Foundation.Generally though, copying open-source code and implementing it separately is not necessarily considered plagiarism. Tronscan has not yet claimed that its implementation is unique or was developed in-house.Nevertheless, one wonders how the Tron community plans to catch up to Ethereum in decentralized finance if it simply retraces its steps — just over two years later."

No. The market is still moving below a significant resistance level at $6,800–$6,900, which is crucial to break to become bullish.Given that the price of Bitcoin moved significantly during the weekend, the markets appeared to open up on the CME futures on Sunday with a gap, as the next chart shows.BTC–USD CME 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe CME chart clearly shows the existence of multiple gaps that are used as an additional narrative for traders. The CME futures opened $600 lower, leaving a gap until $6,620, which is close to being filled by the current price movements of Bitcoin.Alongside this CME gap, the chart also shows multiple other gaps:one at $3,570, one between $8,300 and $9,000, and one at $11,600.Combining the CME information with the price movements of Bitcoin, one conclusion can be drawn from thisrecent price action.Bitcoin remains bearish until $6,900 breaksBTC–USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe price of Bitcoin is still in a bearish momentum until the price can reclaim its previous support at $6,800–$6,900. However, such a move hasn't occurred in the past week, which doesn’t open up for bullish thoughts.By analyzing the daily timeframe, one can seethat the price is range-bound between several levels. The support area is found between $5,800–$5,900 and $5,600, while the resistance areas are found at $6,350–$6,400 and $6,525–$6,575. No clear breakthrough means no clear direction of the market.BTC–USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe four-hour chart shows a similar view. The price of Bitcoin maintained above $6,600 for almost a week, after which $6,900 was firmly rejected.Losing the $6,600 support was a bearish indication, which resulted in the price of Bitcoin dropping to the next support level at $5,800. A clear bearish retest and rejection at $6,550–$6,600 would confirm the downwardmomentum and would also close the CME gap, as discussed previously.The total market capitalization of crypto needs to break $185 billionTotal cryptocurrency market cap 1-week chart.

The $185 billion support zone held during 2018. Therefore, losing this level is an apparent bearish sign, and a clear breakthrough upward would be needed to get a bullish outlook on the markets.Rejection at this level would indicate further downwardmomentum towarda market capof $105 billion to $110 billion, while a breakthrough of $185 billion could indicate further upwardmomentum toward$240 billion to $250 billion.The bullish scenario for BitcoinBTC–USD 2-hour bullish scenario chart.

The structure has to make a higher low in the coming days, through which the $6,050–$6,100 level needs to become supported.The next step would be to reclaim the previous support at $6,600, which is a crucial level to break. If the price of Bitcoin can’t reclaim this level for support, further downwardmomentum is warrantedand the bearish scenario is applied.However, an apparent breakthrough at this level would indicate strength. Likely levels after such a move are the $7,100–$7,200 and $7,500 areas, as it’s to be expected that the price of Bitcoin would reach a new high above $6,900 after reclaiming $6,600.The bearish scenario for BitcoinBTC–USD 2-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewAs stated earlier, the bull/bear scenarios pivot around the $6,600 area. The moment that the $6,600 area is rejectedand the CME gap is closed, further downwardpressure is expected to occur.However, such a move can take some time. The equity markets and cryptomarkets have shown a significant positive correlation recently, as both markets crashed and bounced heavily.After these movements, volatility ends as the dust settles and new structures have to be established. Therefore, range-bound movements are likely to be played out in the cryptocurrency market as well.But a rejection at the $6,600 area would indicate further downwardmomentum and a lower high to be made on the chart. The levels to watch next for support are $5,700–$5,800 and $5,250–$5,400. If the price of Bitcoin drops below $5,250, a further deep drop toward$4,000 can be expected to occur.However, everyone hopes and would like to see Bitcoin break above $6,900, as then the conclusion can be drawn that the price confirmed a V-shape bottom formation.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42188, Bitmain’s Antminer E3 to Continue Mining Ether With New Update ,2020-03-30t14:43:00+01:00,4848,82,"While some cryptocurrency miners are purportedly shutting down due to unprofitability, Chinese mining giant Bitmain continues to not only see its new products sold out but is also improving some of its older flagship devices.Bitmain’s Antminer E3, a popular ASIC miner was suspected to become obsolete by April 2020, will continue mining Ether (ETH) at least till October 2020.Bitmain previously confirmed that Antminer E3 would stop mining EtherAccording to a March 30 blog post, Antminer E3’s lifespan is prolonged with specifically designed firmware launched by Bitmain. According to the announcement, the new firmware was developed to allow miners to continue using Antminer E3 “even after March 2020.”Specifically, Antminer E3’s new firmware addresses a problem with directed acyclic graph (DAG) files, which was first reported by altcoin mining pool 2Miners in February 2020. According to 2Miners, DAG growth was the primary reason for limiting the capability of Antminer E3s for mining Ether and Ethereum Classic (ETC) due to limited memory capacity.While Bitmain subsequently confirmed the DAG growth problem, stating that its double date rate (DDR) memory was approaching the limit of 4GB, 2Miners calculated that Antminer E3 would stop Ether mining roughly on April 8, 2020.Bitmain’s firmware addresses DAG growth issue directlyHowever, Antminer E3’s lifespan has now been extended with the new firmware that addresses the DAG problem directly. According to Bitmain, the new firmware will expand the usage of DDR memory, as more space is needed to process DAG files.With the new firmware update, the final approximate block height of the Antminer E3 is 11,400,000, the blog post says. While Bitmain is confident that E3 miners will continue being operable after April 2020, the miner will still support mining until October 2020, according to the firm’s calculations.Nathaniel Yu, international marketing manager at Bitmain, told Cointelegraph that the Bitmain team started the development of the new firmware at the beginning of 2020. The exec didn’t clarify whether Bitmain started the effort before or after 2Miners reported on the issue.Yu confirmed that Antminer E3 will stop mining Ethereum around October 2020, adding that Bitmain doesn’t plan to extend the device’s lifespan anymore. He said:“As far as we know, mining will approximately end during October or sometime after this. This is the latest firmware update developed for the Antminer E3. Currently, we have not made any plans to develop future updates at the moment.”Released by Bitmain in April 2018, Antminer E3 was touted as the “world's most powerful and efficient EtHash ASIC miner.” As reported by Cointelegraph, Ethash is the Proof-of-Work (PoW) hashing algorithm used by Ethereum and a variety of other altcoins such as ETC. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network is poised to gradually shift from PoW to Proof-of-Stake consensus.Update April 1, 12:30 UTC: This article was updated to add additional information provided by Bitmain that the firm doesn’t plan to extend Antminer E3’s lifespan to operate after October 2020."

PeterM stated that the cyber offensive “looks like a typical Ryuk attack,” posting:“I can confirm that#Ryuk ransomware are still targeting hospitals despite the global pandemic. I'm looking at a US health care provider at the moment who were targeted overnight. Any HC providers reading this, if you have a TrickBot infection get help dealing with it ASAP.”Two of seven ransomware operators claim to cease targeting hospitalsOn March 18, cybersecurity publication BleepingComputer published a report after contacting seven ransomware operators to ask if they would continue to target hospitals despite the COVID-19 outbreak.Only Maze and DoppelPaymer indicated that they would no longer target hospitals. Maze later decrypted and released data that it had stolen from a drug testing company that it had targeted prior to the pandemic.Ryuk did not respond to the publication’s request for commentOne week later, Bleepingcomputer reported that software security firm SentinelOne had identified at least ten instances of Ryuk targeting at least 10 healthcare organizations during March — including one attack on a network of 9 hospitals.Dutch cybersecurity firm freely fights ransomware for hospitalsAs part of the “Tech against Corona” initiative — where a consortium of local tech companies are freely offering their services and technologies to the Dutch government to fight COVID-19 — IT security firm Cybersprint is helping hospitals fight ransomware.In addition to providing its security services to the hospitals free of charge, it is also conducting a deep investigation into recent ransomware attacks to develop best practices to secure against future incidents."

Mashinky stated that his company is paying out weekly interest on their deposits to the partner while Chainlink is able “to borrow dollars when they need them so they do not have to sell coins”.Incremental decentralizationChainlink’s CEO Sergey Nazarov told Cointelegraph that the partnership is important to him personally, as it proves that incremental decentralization works:“I think many teams could benefit from reexamining an incremental/gradual approach to decentralizing their financial product/application, people might think decentralization is a binary decision, because that's what it looked like when they started building their application. They might think “either I go fully decentralized or fully centralized”, they don't always consider a middle path where they can gradually decentralize their application.”According to Mashinsky, not a single institutional client of Celsius defaulted during the recent market meltdown. Perhaps, further decentralization of its technological stack will make the company even more robust."
42183, Opera Becomes First Major Browser to Integrate .Crypto Domain Extension ,2020-03-30t14:00:00+01:00,4368,1048,"Opera now enables users to access decentralized web pages through a partnership with Unstoppable Domains, a tech firm backed by prominent Bitcoin (BTC) advocate Tim Draper.The collaboration entails Opera’s integration of Unstoppable Domain’s .crypto domain extension, according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on March 26. This will allow the browser’s users to surf decentralized websites, as well as make cryptocurrency payments.No more middlemanAs the announcement further explains, blockchain domains are stored by the owner instead of by registrar firms, and decentralized websites are stored on peer-to-peer networks, not cloud services. This makes it possible to conduct transactions without a middleman, as well as avoid censorship.Unstoppable Domains told Cointelegraph that the development will affect the speed of the internet connection as, over time, a distributed network is more robust, has far better uptime and will reduce the risk of incidents like DDoS attacks.What about countries with internet censorship?Unstoppable Domains noted that, while decentralized domains can help people avoid censorship from the publishing side, they do little to aid viewers in jurisdictions that face censorship, surveillance and de-anonymization issues:“Just as with the current web, if users are facing those types of issues they would need to use VPNs or a similar tool. Decentralized websites solve a user’s ability to publish — it’s on the publishing side rather than on the viewing side. Right now, you can't publish using a traditional domain registrar if you're in a place that is limiting free speech. Whereas, with decentralized website tools, you could. So it’s about the publishing and not the viewing.”Blockchain-based browsers go mainstreamThe development ostensibly marks the first time a mainstream browser has integrated a domain that is not part of the traditional domain name system. Last October, Opera also became the first major browser that allows making payments with Bitcoin (BTC) directly inside the browser.Meanwhile, Unstoppable Domains has rolled out its own blockchain-based browser to simplify access to the decentralized web. Unstoppable Domains’ websites are stored in a user’s wallet, while the content is stored on the InterPlanetary File System or other decentralized storage networks."
42182, Crypto ‘Dutch Auctions’ Show Promise After $1.76M Offering Sells Out ,2020-03-30t12:51:00+01:00,2536,69,"On March 24, United States-based blockchain company Solana successfully sold all of its tokens via a “Launch Auction” hosted by crypto fundraising firm CoinList.Solana raised $1.76 million from 445 bids placed from 91 different companies. 8 million SOL tokens were distributed at $0.22 each. 1,416 prospective investors had registered to participate.CoinList’s Launch Auction token issuance model comprises a “Dutch auction” — where the bidding for a token begins at an initial price ceiling which is dropped by a fixed amount periodically.Investors bid for the number of tokens that they wish to purchase at a given price until either all tokens are sold or the price drops down to a reserve price set by the issuer. Solana had set its price floor at $0.04 per token.Solana Launch Auction sells outIn total, Solana has raised $25.6 million through issuing 186 million tokens or 37.2% of its total supply across four fundraising rounds.In its seed round the firm raised $3.2 million from 79.4 million tokens at $0.04 per token, before issuing 63.2 million tokens at $0.20 each to raise $12.6 million, followed by its validator round which raised $5.7 million through issuing 25.3 million tokens at $0.225 per token. Solana will also issue a further 10 million tokens through its forthcoming strategic round.Given the volatility across all markets and the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we find these figures especially impressive,” said CoinList.Solana claims to offer greater scaling efficiency owing to its “Proof-of-History” protocol.Dutch auction shows promise as crypto fundraising methodThough not as widely known as initial coin offerings (ICOs) or initial exchange offerings (IEOs), the cryptocurrency industry is no stranger to Dutch auctions.In June 2019, the Algorand Foundation raised $60 million in a Dutch auction that issued 25 million ALGO tokens. The offering began at $10 per token, with the price being driven down to $2.40 over the course of 4,000 rounds of bidding.In 2017, crypto firm Gnosis introduced plans to launch a decentralized exchange for ERC-20 token issuances modeled on Dutch auctions. While Gnosis has since stepped away from dxDAO, the platform exchange is still operating today."

The system will reportedly be able to identify supply priority levels as well as mitigate the risks of counterfeit or unlicensed products being distributed to regions.Big-name Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba Group and Huawei are reportedly focusing their energies on providing artificial intelligence solutions that can enhance diagnostic solutions for the public health crisis.Blockchain in the time of COVID-19As reported, academic researchers have previously argued that the widespread use of blockchain and AI technology by the likes of Alibaba, SF Express and Apple should be replicated by charitable organizations and government-led public health initiatives.Castigating Beijing’s choice to funnel all public donations through five government-backed charity organizations, academic Syren Johnstone said that less centralized blockchain systems would provide more public visibility, accountability and reliability than current approaches to the crisis.At a regional level, however, as many as 20 new blockchain-based applications designed to help fight the outbreak had reportedly been launched in China by mid-February, several in collaboration with provincial authorities.This weekend, the World Health Organization partnered with major blockchain and tech companies to launch a distributed ledger technology-based platform for sharing data connected with the pandemic."

Santander Portugal and Chile joined the solution the following year.The blockchain system’s benefits, Santander claims, is transparency, predictability, competitive cost and better speed, ostensibly countering current customer experiences which it describes as “sub-optimal” and prone to “client stickiness.”Years of collaborationAs previously reported, Santander and Ripple developed One PayFX over several years, with early trials indicating that the solution could provide improvements over traditional transfers as early as 2016. In 2015, Santander’s capital arm InnoVentures, contributed $4 million to Ripple’s $32 million series A funding.RippleNet, first created in 2012, continues to undergo technical developments, including “core consensus improvements,” according to recent comments from Ripple’s chief technology officer David Schwartz. Schwartz has also signaled his interest in enabling third parties to launch other third-party cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, on the XRP ledger.Last week, Cointelegraph reported on new amendments to a class-action lawsuit leveled against Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, which centers on allegations that Ripple violated the U.S. Securities Act in its 2013 initial coin offering for the XRP token."

42170, Roger Ver Apparently Unconcerned About Coronavirus ,2020-03-30t09:22:00+01:00,3315,72,"Roger Ver, the prominent Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate and former CEO of Bitcoin.com, appears to think that the world’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionate.In a tweet published on March 29, Ver tweeted a screenshot of statistics ostensibly comparing the global COVID-19 death toll with that of other illnesses — including seasonal flu, malaria and traffic fatalities — between Jan. 1 and March 25, 2020.The screenshot was accompanied by Ver’s remark that “if YOU are worried about the coronavirus, YOU should self isolate. Leave the rest of us alone.”Ver notably did not disclose the source of the statistics, which appear to indicate that deaths from traffic fatalities (313,903), malaria (228,095) and suicides (249,904) eclipsed those from COVID-19 (21,297) by a factor of more than 10 as of March 25; deaths from seasonal flu (113,034) ostensibly exceeded those from the virus by a factor of more than 5.HIV/AIDS was the most lethal disease included in Ver’s screenshot, causing an ostensible 390,908 deaths in the same period.As of press time, on March 30, the cumulative global death toll from COVID-19 is officially recorded as being close to 34,000.While some countries continue to buck the trend, an estimated one-third of the world’s population was under state-enforced lockdown as of Wednesday last week, as governments struggle to suppress the virus’ transmission and reduce the burden on public health systems.The debate over the efficacy and implementation of these interventionist measures — unprecedented in peacetime — continues to unfold within the scientific and political communities.Ver, a self-identified libertarian, did not explain his objections to self-isolation measures, which some claim curtail civil liberties, or are a detriment to the economy.The World Health Organization’s official recommendations on containment of the COVID-19 pandemic include widespread testing, quarantine of confirmed cases, contact tracing, and social distancing measures. Countries such as South Korea have been able to avoid lockdowns by implementing mass testing, contact tracing and focused quarantining early on in the outbreak.A cautionary note on the dataThe integrity of all statistics currently being used to track the pandemic remains a vexed issue, with analysts repeatedly emphasizing their incompleteness due to inadequate testing and the non-admission of initially mild cases to public health facilities.Multiple reports worldwide have contended that many victims are likely not to have been diagnosed at the time of death, or that governments have chosen to under-represent mortality rates for political reasons. The inconsistency between different countries’ approaches to determining direct causality on death certificates further obscures the picture.An outlier?Ver, who faced a backlash on social media for his stance, has found common ground with at least one fellow arch-libertarian in the crypto space. On March 26, John McAfee, also used a comparison of fatality statistics to apparently support his claim that people are “being manipulated” and should “wake up.”Other community leaders have focused their energies on charitable initiatives to combat the pandemic, including Binance Charity, Ripple Labs and the #cryptoCOVID19 alliance."

Speaking to Cointelegraph, EOS NY founder Kevin Rose said:“We are deeply grateful for the way the community has embraced our team over these past few years. EOS NY was shut down prior to our joining Block.one, and EOS NY was not part of our move. We are excited to continue as a community participant in these new roles at Block.one.""Block.one has said that its hire of Kevin Rose, co-founder Rick Schlesinger and the EOS NY team is aimed at deepening its “engagement with public blockchain communities” and to “promote ideas to foster open, organized, and decentralized public network operation, and represent its interests as a token holder of several public digital assets.”Block Producers’ roleAs previously reported, EOS Block Producers (BPs) are analogous to miners on the Proof-of-Work-based Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain or staking nodes on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol.The difference with EOS lies in its consensus mechanism, known as “delegated proof-of-stake,” whereby — in keeping with the governance terms set by EOS’ constitution — network participants are able to stake their tokens to vote for their BPs as “elected delegates.”Rather than staking their token holdings as in a PoS system, Block Producers stake their investment in the network in the form of infrastructure, community support and development.Block.one deferred disclosing details of the team’s new responsibilities in their roles, stating that their integration into the company was still in the early days and that details would be shared as new initiatives unfold.Recent developmentsOn March 27, Block.one announced an investment of $150 million into its U.S.-only blockchain-based social media network, Voice. The platform, still in beta testing, has drawn criticism for its data handling, whereby a U.K.-based firm reserves the right to share all user data collected with its employees and contracted third parties.In early January, Block.one released the latest version of the software underlying the EOS blockchain, EOS.io 2.0, which includes a purpose-built WebAssembly (WASM) engine for EOS smart contracts, as well as multithreading support as part of the network code."

However, if these numbers from Coinbase Commerce are any indication, it seems that more retailers are warming up to the idea.Coinbase’s stablecoin big winner of crypto bloodbathWhile BTC was one of the hardest hit during the crypto downtown on March 12, stablecoins reaped some benefits: the transfer value hit an all-time high of $444 million the day after the crash.Coinbase’s own stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), was one to which crypto holders may have been turning in an attempt to preserve their capital following the bloodbath. In terms of market caps, USDC reported a 57% increase over a thirty-day period ending on March 25.Both USDC and other stablecoins can be used for crypto purchases on Coinbase Commerce. The platform recently added MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin as a supported payment method."

On March 26, the startup announced on twitter that beta users can now collect limited indoor special items, such as toilet rolls, hand sanitizers, and facemasks. By participating, users could help raise money to help fight COVID-19. The company explained that:“Triffic is raising up to $10,000 for COVID-19 Response by donating GPSTokens every time a beta user collects an AugmentedReality, toilet roll, hand sanitizer or #facemask.”Triffic told Cointelegraph that its business model is based on the ability of their users to move freely and collect beacons. With many people on lockdown, they decided to implement this idea as a way to help raise social awareness. The company’s goal is to donate to an important cause while promoting the beta test of their game at the same time. The team added that:“Who wouldn’t want to collect virtual toilet papers instead of Pokemons, right?”Public health officials have recommended social distancing as a way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. So far, these efforts have been successful in countries such as China and South Korea where the virus first occurred.Other companies are doing their part as well.

The election was the first live project to be executed using Vodafone’s digital identity platform.“We are pleased to have been the first use-case for the Vodafone [digital identity] platform, and as far as we can tell a world first to hold a student election on a blockchain, “ said Joshua Ellul, the director of the University of Malta’s Centre for Distributed Ledger Technologies.Malta University students build decentralized voting applicationWhile the application was built to allow voters autonomous control over their data rather than relinquishing personal data to a centralized entity, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some of the advantages offered by remote voting platforms. Ellul stated:“At this time especially, given the current situation, it was important to have a remote voting mechanism in place that enables trust and transparency thanks to the Blockchain-based solution.”Ellul stated the biggest challenge to developing the platform was “onboarding users in a trusted manner,” adding that “digital identity platforms such as that provided by Vodafone provide a solution.”Voting is private but transparent, meaning that the results of an election can be publicly verified.The University of Malta introduced its blockchain masters course during October 2019.New Malta government to continue fostering a ‘blockchain island’Malta has long been a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Whether that would remain the case appeared unclear when the now-former Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, resigned after facing widespread allegations of corruption and ties to the political assassination of a journalist.While the new government-issued statements indicating that leading crypto exchange, Binance, is licensed in the country shortly after taking office, the new government has expressed that its position regarding blockchain has not changed for the time being.

42156, Why Ethereum Should Go Mobile ,2020-03-29t23:40:00+01:00,6498,186,"We live in an increasingly mobile world where I can order a vehicle driven by a complete stranger to take me anywhere, I can get food delivered in minutes, and I can conduct almost all my immediate banking needs — all via apps on my phone. We’re in a decade when firing up a computer to do these tasks would seem tedious compared to quickly swiping on a phone. Computers are no longer required, let alone optimal over mobile access, and this innovative trend has big implications for the future of Ethereum.Mobile applications are the future, and they’re increasingly showing promise over desktop and web technologies. Today, we spend 42% of our time online using mobile devices rather than computers, a massive transition from 10 years ago. This move to mobile is coming to crypto, and tech giants like Samsung and HTC are already leading the charge with blockchain phones, and large-scale blockchain companies like Coinbase and Ledger have released mobile apps. Continued research and innovation are what’s opened mobile to become a secure place to store and transact with digital assets.Recent global events like the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate how interconnected and reliant we are on digital networks for goods and information. In this context, being able to communicate, transact, conduct business, take out loans and manage assets from a mobile device is a great advantage, if not a necessity with social distancing. Mobile access to Ethereum and decentralized finance can make a big difference as we all weather this pandemic.Opportunity in emerging marketsAnyone under 40 likely has just as much experience or more with smartphones than they do with computers. Globally, people use their phones for basic banking tasks, and many of them don’t own computers at all.Two years ago, there was practically no such thing as open decentralized finance. DeFi allows anyone to create and access a host of new financial tools that have sprung from the Ethereum blockchain. Payments, commerce, banking, lending, capital markets, insurance and asset tokenization are all part of DeFi. Its reach disrupts every major area of the global financial infrastructure. Today, there is just under $700 million invested or staked in the DeFi ecosystem, which has generated over $50 million in premiums.Mobile access, and the fact that these financial tools are open to anyone, without the restrictions of central bankers, means that people in emerging economies have more access than ever to banking instruments — even people who can’t open a bank account in their home country. Reduced friction across borders and less volatility than local fiat currencies make it particularly attractive in these markets.But are phones actually safe?These devices offer convenience and access, but should you be worried they’re not as secure as desktop applications? The reality may shock you, but the security of a desktop app is only as good as its design and maintenance. If a computer desktop app is not regularly updated by developers (because they don’t have enough resources for three different desktop platforms) and by users (because they forget to do so), it becomes less secure than a mobile app that is updated regularly by developers and updated automatically for users.Besides, in terms of security, what really matters for storing your Ether (ETH) and transacting in the Ethereum ecosystem is key management. That is, how private keys are stored and transactions are signed. For these purposes, today’s smartphones can offer a much greater level of security than has ever been available on a PC.On modern mobile devices, crypto wallet apps can generate keys, put them through several layers of encryption incorporating unique biometric data, and then place them in secure local storage that is architecturally separated from the rest of the system. Keys are always kept away from the internet, making them practically immune to hacks and malware. In addition, some phones, like Samsung blockchain devices, are specifically designed for secure key management, much like a hardware wallet. Mobile apps have fewer vectors for attack and more layers of security compared to a PC, eliminating many instances of user error.Ethereum should go mobileCombining the access of DeFi on Ethereum with the increasing global use of smartphones, the future of Ethereum hinges on mobile access. There are more than 5 billion smartphones in the world and with online banking becoming the norm, it only makes sense for Ethereum’s biggest access point to be mobile.More than 30% of the United States population has an account at an online-only bank or plans to open one. DeFi services will soon become the new norm in emerging economies. How can we make DeFi mainstream? We need to make it even more accessible than traditional financial services. DeFi projects must go mobile to make it easier for people to buy digital assets and participate. A large percentage of the unbanked population that stands to benefit most from decentralized finance has never and will never own a computer. In the meantime, the developing world has hit 98.7% mobile phone adoption.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Kosala Hemachandra is the founder of noncustodial wallet MyEtherWallet.

It highlights that in 2015, deals from US-based companies accounted for 51% of Blockchain tech growth. Comparatively China-based companies represented only 2%. However, the balance has now tipped in China’s favor.Data indicates that in 2019, the percentage of deals enacted by U.S. startups fell to 31%. During the same year, China’s market share grew to 22%, thus consolidating itself within the blockchain sphere.Reasons behind China’s blockchain-related investmentsSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Tomer Weiss, co-founder and head of partnerships at Upright, explained the following:“I think that China sees the potential of blockchain for enterprises to understand better, track and get an insight about the financial activity of individuals and business since the announcement of Xi [Jinping] about blockchain, there are a lot of investments.”Referencing blockchain, China’s president, Xi Jinping, called on the country to accelerate its adoption of such technology as a core for innovation during a speech on October 24, 2019. President Xi issued the following comments to the Politburo Committee session, which discussed blockchain technology trends:“We must take blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main directions, increase investment, focus on a number of key technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.”Less interest in DeFi and crypto funding in ChinaWeiss clarifies that most of China’s blockchain-related investments are directed towards enterprise implementations and government infrastructure. Considerably less money is going towards developing customer-facing DeFi solutions.Weiss further clarified the following regarding crypto project investments:“Investors think that maybe it’s not the right timing to bet on DApps, wallet or DeFi - and regulation indeed is a major reason for that.”Other highlights from the researchThe CB Insights report also concludes that Bitcoin continues to behave like a risk-on asset and is therefore not yet a feasible store of value.However, despite the recent market sell-off, the research ensures that companies will continue to build and launch products which benefit the maturing blockchain ecosystem."

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.Top Stories This WeekA calmer week for Bitcoin — but price may not return to $10,000 soonBitcoin remained largely steady in the mid-$6,000s for most of this week but failed to punch through levels above $6,900. Analysts, such as Cointelegraph’s Michaël van de Poppe, have warned BTC isn’t in any bullish market right now, even as global stock markets show signs of a slight recovery. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin holders appear to be withdrawing their funds — with exchange balances at their lowest level in about eight months. On Wednesday, a “death cross” emerged that suggests BTC will struggle to return to five figures before May. Even though BTC might end up trading sideways between $6,000 and $8,000 for some time yet, a poll of “VIP” Kraken users suggests most traders think the world’s biggest cryptocurrency will hit all-time highs before 2021. The survey found that the average BTC price target for this year is $22,866.Vitalik Buterin proposes solution to “embarrassing” lack of Bitcoin–Ethereum bridgeEthereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin has described the lack of easy movement between the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks as “embarrassing” — and is calling for a decentralized exchange to act as a trustless bridge between the two networks. The programmer also revealed that he has held talks with Electric Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn about creating a DEX bridge from ETH to the privacy coin Zcash. A lack of liquidity has stymied the progress of decentralized exchanges to date, but a dedicated BTC–ETH bridge supported by Buterin could enjoy greater levels of uptake.World Health Organization launches blockchain platform to fight COVID-19Could blockchain technology help slow the spread of the coronavirus? The World Health Organization hopes so. It is partnering with major blockchain and tech companies to launch a DLT-based platform that enables data to be shared more easily. Known as MiPasa, it’s hoped the network will achieve the “early detection of COVID-19 carriers and infection hotspots.” Built on top of Hyperledger Fabric in conjunction with the likes of IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, it aims to facilitate “fully private information sharing between individuals, state authorities and health institutions.” In other developments this week, Ripple Labs announced it is donating $200,000 to two non-profits fighting to contain the spread of coronavirus in the U.S.Battle for the digital dollar in America’s coronavirus stimulus billThis week, the biggest financial stimulus package in the United States’s history was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Worth $2 trillion, it’s hoped the drastic measures will help firms and consumers weather the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The U.S. has now overtaken China and Italy in the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide. One draft version of the bill included the requirement to develop a digital dollar, meaning all those entitled to financial aid would receive it in a free bank account. Alas, all mention of digital dollars was later erased from a later iteration of the legislation. Under the measures approved by Trump, every American who earns less than $75,000 a year will receive a direct payment of $1,200 — with $500 for every child.Canada’s tax authority demands personal data on 115,000 QuadrigaCX usersThe seemingly never-ending saga of QuadrigaCX has taken another turn. Canada’s Revenue Agency has requested 750,000 documents on the exchange’s 115,000 customers — many of whom lost money when the company collapsed. EY, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, is going to hand over a database containing personal user information, account balances and transaction histories between 2016 and 2018. A committee of affected users has given its approval because launching a dispute would be expensive and time-consuming. Not everyone is happy with the decision. Committee member Magdalena Grownowska described the demand as “an unprecedented affront to individual privacy,” and cautioned the Canadian taxman may have other motives.Winners and LosersAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $6,138.63, Ether at $128.87 and XRP at $0.17.

It will come of age in this one.”Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital founder and CEO“I only have bullish scenarios for Bitcoin. Yes, I would say 6,800 is a key level that has played out before…I would say overall, I mean, we're looking at a very wide range for Bitcoin, something between $3,100 and $20,000.”Mati Greenspan, Quantum Economics co-founder and CEO“Going above $6,800 would maybe give me 85% confidence we’re not going to go below this — and we’re almost there, we’ve almost broken it; we’re sitting at resistance.”Tone Vays, trader“It's embarrassing that we still can't easily move between the two largest crypto ecosystems trustlessly.”Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder“As we get used to talk about Trillions, a modest $2 trillion market cap of #bitcoin will put 1 BTC at $100,000. Not such a hard to imagine number now, right?”Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO“Only fools are choosing Bitcoin. So far this year gold is up over 7%, while Bitcoin is down 3%. Gold is only 2% from its 2020 high, while Bitcoin is 35% below its 2020 high!”Peter Schiff, crypto skeptic“$BTC will continue to be volatile over the next few months but the macro backdrop is WHY it was created. This will be and needs to be BTC’s year.”Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital founderPrediction of the WeekAs Trump talks trillions, Binance CEO predicts $2 trillion Bitcoin market capMany were shocked at the scale of the U.S. stimulus package in light of the coronavirus. The Federal Reserve has started churning out fiat money to prevent a deeper financial crash — and has even suggested it could print an infinite amount of cash. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has predicted that this could be good news for Bitcoin. He tweeted that a BTC price of $100,000 is “not such a hard to imagine number now,” adding that this would achieve a “modest” market capitalization of $2 trillion. As modest as such a projection may be, it’s some way off BTC’s current market cap of $112.3 billion — and the industry’s overall valuation of $173 billion.FUD of the WeekSuspicions grow during BitBay’s 18-hour outageBitBay was offline for more than 18 hours this week — disruption blamed on a “network problem” with an “external service provider.” The company claims to be the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in Europe, with more than 800,000 users. Alarm bells quickly started ringing as the outage rumbled on, with the exchange resorting to a Facebook live stream to calm users. It stressed that “all fiat and crypto funds are safe” and asked for a “little more trust” as work continued to bring the platform back online. Some users suggested that the so-called “network problem” was a cover story for a much bigger issue. Trading has now resumed.Billionaire demands Facebook reveal who placed scam Bitcoin ads about himThe billionaire ex-husband of Janet Jackson has demanded that Facebook reveals who was behind ads on the platform that used his image to promote a Bitcoin scam. Wissam Al Mana alleges that a cryptocurrency firm called “Bitcoin Trader” used his name to promote itself in the Middle East. Facebook has deleted the offending ads, but Al Mana fears fraudsters could publish similar ads in the future. His lawyers now want the social media giant to unmask the ad’s publishers — and share their names, addresses, contact details and payment methods. Crypto scams have increasingly been injecting stardust into their campaigns to achieve false legitimacy. Kate Winslet, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Richard Branson have all had their identities recently appropriated by swindlers.California governor namedrops Bitcoin in speech about “extraordinarily bad people”Gavin Newsom has warned the public to be vigilant against Bitcoin fraudsters during the coronavirus pandemic — namedropping the cryptocurrency in a speech about “extraordinarily bad people, who do extraordinarily bad things.” The California governor has warned there are criminals who are using the health crisis to their advantage. He’s not alone. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has warned scammers are likely to use the coronavirus to add credibility to their scams or manipulate emotions. Some online perpetrators have even been impersonating the World Health Organization in an attempt to steal cryptocurrency donations intended to fight the pandemic.Best Cointelegraph FeaturesBig tech in blockchain: Comparing IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Google and moreThe world’s largest technology companies have made concerted efforts to investigate and integrate blockchain technologies over the past few years.

42144, Blockchain to Revolutionize Luxury Watch Ownership ,2020-03-29t21:00:00+01:00,4884,118,"Digital identity consortium, Arianee, has authenticated a limited batch of luxury wallets using its blockchain protocol.On March 26, Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling announced the release of a limited edition chronograph certified using the Arianee protocol. Each individual Top Time watch will be given a unique digital identity using distributed ledger technology.Breitling Issues First Blockchain-Based Digital Warranty For Mechanical WatchBreitling, which was founded in 1884, claims to be the first watchmaker to issue watches with a warranty program certified using blockchain technology. Each watch will be sold with its own e-warranty card. Scanning these cards will allow owners to download an encrypted wallet that securely stores the products' digital “passport.”The passport contains data pertaining to that individual watch, including its serial number and a timestamp indicating the date from which the warranty is activated.“Only accessible by the owner through the wallet, this passport includes a transfer feature that enables the owner to prove the authenticity of the watch, and his or her legal ownership,” Breitling’s website states.If an owner is to sell their Top Time watch, only the transfer of the digital passport is needed to authenticate the new ownership of the timepiece. Emmanuelle Collet, Arianne’s co-founder and CMO, stated:“We are proud to be able to offer an augmented ownership experience to Breitling’s Top Time clients through an enhanced warranty program.”Arianne Targets Digital Identification of Luxury FashionArianne claims to have pioneered the digital identification of watches, describing its June 2019 partnership with Vacheron as producing the first-ever watches uniquely identified using blockchain technology.In recent months, Arianee has sought to find applications for blockchain technology within the luxury fashion industry — with the non-profit’s CEO and co-founder Perre-Nicolas Hurstel speaking at fashion conferences hosted by Premiere Vision Paris and Vogue in Paris during February 2020.Blockchain-Based Identity Certification Moves Towards MainstreamBlockchain technology is being used for digital identity certification in an increasing number of mainstream industries.At the end of February, South Korea’s Nonghyup bank rolled out a “mobile employee ID” system using distributed ledger technology. This ID technology was developed in partnership with tech giant, Samsung and the system will be implemented through the country’s largest wireless carrier, SK Telecom.On March 25, the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) Ministry of Community Development (MOCD) revealed that it will rely on blockchain-based digital identity authentication to issue documents amid MOCD office closures resulting from the COVID-19 lockdown."
42143, Fake Ledger Chrome Extensions Continue to Steal Crypto From Victims ,2020-03-29t20:00:00+01:00,4959,112,"Fake Google Chrome extensions for crypto hardware wallet manufacturer and custody provider, Ledger, continue to claim victims.On March 28, a post was published to Reddit by a user seeking to warn others that they had just lost 14,908 Ripple (XRP) (roughly $2,577) to a fake Ledger Wallet extension on the Google Chrome store.According to the poster, ‘leannekera’, the lost funds comprised a nest egg that she and her husband had been growing since 2017. The wallet that her XRP was sent to quickly forwarded her funds to a second wallet that currently holds nearly 15 million in XRP.Fake Ledger Wallet Chrome extension claims COVID-19 patient as victimLeannekera claims to be a confirmed victim of COVID-19. She states that she is in self-imposed isolation in a single room of her house. She also notes that her husband works in an ‘essential industry’ in the United Kingdom.In response to financial difficulties resulting from her isolation, leannekera sought to liquidate some of her family’s crypto holdings, and move any excess funds into XRP. She stated:“I begin the day by selling a load of our other cryptocurrency for bitcoin, sold some to help us and I then consolidate the remaining into xrp. I then load up our Ledger. It’s been a while since I last accessed our Ledger (2018), and have since changed my computer. I recalled the Ledger having a Chrome extension and this is when the scam starts.”Leannekera recounts finding only one Ledger extension on the Chrome store, with the application claiming affiliation with Ledger.com and boasting 70 positive reviews of between four and five stars. When prompted, she entered her Ledger’s recovery seed into the extension — allowing the funds to be stolen.Ledger warns of malicious Chrome extensionsOn March 5, Ledger published a tweet warning users of malicious Chrome extensions. These extensions — identified by cybersecurity researcher Harry Denley — claim to be directly affiliated with the company. The application seeks to emulate Ledger’s desktop and mobile application Ledger Live and was even advertised on Google Ads.By March 24, researchers at xrplorer forensics estimated that a fake Ledger extension had absorbed 1.4 million XRP in March alone.Crypto scammers target hardware wallet usersOpportunistic scammers have long sought to target hardware wallet users, with hackers even distributing fake hardware wallets imitating the appearance of Tezor or Ledger products at crypto conferences in 2017.Last October, a now-deleted Reddit user posted a link to a Shopify website purporting to offer KeepKey hardware wallets for only $5 — triggering the suspicions of other Redditors.During May 2019, researchers also discovered a fake Chrome extension targeting Trezor users."
42142," Canada’s New AML Rules Have Room for Improvement but a Good Start, Eh? ",2020-03-29t19:33:00+01:00,3823,98,"As the world’s supervisory agencies start to heed the crypto guidelines of the Financial Action Task Force, a new regulatory landscape is taking shape within the crypto industry. The latest country to annex the FATF directives is Canada, but how will the new rules impact crypto business in the country?In a report released March 10, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada, or FINTRAC, unveiled plans for an “enhanced AML regime.” Come June 1, 2020, FINTRAC will treat all crypto firms as money service business, or MSB. This will place added scrutiny on cryptocurrency transfers, customer identification and foreign money services dealing with crypto.Chief among the new requirements is the divisive travel rule. When the regime comes into play, firms will have to record the name, address and account details for transactions above 1,000 Canadian dollars. The regime forms part of a comprehensive drive to strengthen the integrity of the Canadian financial system.In 2016, a FATF assessment of Canada’s Anti-Money Laundering framework exposed the crypto industry as one of the country’s most vulnerable sectors. Several years later, it seems that FATF was proven right in the wake of the QuadrigaCX scandal, which resulted in losses of around 200 million Canadian dollars. The move toward AML augmentation will undoubtedly satisfy the FATF, but how will Canada’s crypto-centric businesses fare under the new regulations?A new regimeCointelegraph reached out to several Canada-based crypto firms to get their take on the regime and what it may hold in store for them. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Dean Skurka, head of finance and compliance at Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Bitbuy, noted that businesses with standards in place stand to gain from the new regime:“One of the largest impacts to Dealers of Virtual Currencies will be their internal reporting and external reporting requirements. Companies that have been preparing for this regime over the last few years will benefit greatly as their systems will be well established prior to the June 1, 2020, deadline. Those that have not will have to significantly ramp up, as it is a lot of effort and should not be treated lightly.”Ultimately, Skurka said the ordinance will “improve the climate for consumers” by mitigating some of the money laundering risks associated with crypto. Nevertheless, while praising the entrance of regulatory clarity, Skurka inferred that crypto firms would likely face the same banking challenges as traditional MSBs.Adam Cai, CEO of Toronto-based crypto exchange VirgoCX, told Cointelegraph that an enhanced AML structure would propel industry legitimacy by dislodging poor operating standards:“To some, this may appear to be a hinderance, but in reality, it will force management teams to perform proper planning and to act more responsibly. Our industry is still reeling from the impact of QuadrigaCX and Einstein. Our hope is that the new regulations will aid to restore trust in the industry.”Indeed, the fallout from the QuadrigaCX debacle has left a bitter taste in the mouths of investors and regulators alike. However, when it comes to regulation, user privacy remains a focal dilemma. Recently, Canada’s tax authority, the Canada Revenue Agency, subpoenaed the defunct exchange for user information, giving rise to creditor concerns of privacy infringement. The new regime is liable to deepen these concerns as stringent requirements come into practice.Consequently, David Waslen, CEO and co-founder of Canada-based social trading platform HedgeTrade, believes a firmer hand could to push innovation away from Canada entirely:“It’s hard to see effective regulations coming from this when you think of all the companies in Canada that want to use innovative technologies but are often forced to relocate to places like Singapore, which have a far more nimble and progressive stance on emerging technologies. With the speed of innovation in the blockchain sector, some companies might feel it is better to base their operations somewhere that has clearer guidelines and a more streamlined process to compliance.”Waslen also suggested the semantics used by FINTRAC leave little to be desired, noting that while regulatory efforts were a step forward, continued stigmatization is keeping the industry on the back foot:“It is good to have these guidelines, but it seems as though the government may still consider crypto startups as part of the ‘underground economy.’ This continued focus on the misuse of crypto, as opposed to the positive benefits of crypto, is what might be the biggest hindrance.”The trouble with the travel ruleThe FATF’s travel rule — soon to be instilled into Canada’s own regime — requires exchanges to unveil the name, geographical address and account details for transfers above a specific threshold.Traditional financial institutions achieve this via interbank messaging service SWIFT. However, the pseudonymous quality of cryptocurrencies makes this undertaking virtually unmanageable. Unlike conventional monetary transfers, crypto payments display only a string of alphanumeric characters — making identification a reasonably onerous task.Related: Governments Begin to Roll Out FATF’s Travel Rule Around the GlobeExecution of the travel rule isn’t just a technical headache: It’s a major pain point for those who are privacy-conscious. Nevertheless, according to Bitbuy’s Skurka, as long as the travel rule is applied correctly — and in a way that protects user privacy — it could usher in a new era of transparency as “it will solve many of the issues related to cash, SWIFT wire transfers and law enforcement’s inability to track the criminal element.”While VirgoCX’s Cai conceded that the community won’t come around to the new reality any time soon, he believes travel rule compliance can come without a significant cost to industry participants:“Our hope is that the new rules and guidance will enable greater adoption of cryptocurrency and greater acceptance of our industry as a whole from banks. Ultimately, greater adoption from the general public and from chartered banks can only be good for the industry.”Canada’s classification conundrumOverall, the Canadian regulatory atmosphere appears to be supportive of emerging technologies. However, Waslen warns that while government-sanctioned research into blockchain technology is evident, appropriate cryptocurrency classification remains fairly elusive:“Businesses that want to issue or use a cryptocurrency have no case law defining what is a security and what is not. They continue to attempt to adapt these decades-old laws to entities that often do not fit perfectly into all of their official criteria.”Many cryptocurrencies fall under securities law in Canada. In January, the Canadian Securities Administrator issued new guidance to interpret when a crypto trade would fall outside of their purview. The CSA noted that as long as an asset isn’t a derivative or tokenized asset, it wouldn’t class as a security.Related: Canada Pushes to Regulate Crypto Adoption, Forgoing Volatile BTC PastHowever, according to the CSA, this only applies to non-custodial dealers — i.e., decentralized exchanges. Centralized entities in charge of user funds must abide by securities regulation. As a consequence, many crypto firms have been treading in unknown territory. However, Waslen remains positive that FINTRAC’s enhanced AML regime will “quicken the pace” of compliance. Nonetheless, he argued, the crux of the issue remains:“[The AML regime] centers on the government’s role in enforcing compliance, but does not necessarily help when it comes to clearing up that gray area for crypto companies wanting to use virtual currencies.”It appears that even with FINTRAC striving to bring order to the crypto industry, some pervasive issues remain. Still, for the most part, the consensus among Canada’s crypto firms is that well-executed regulation will benefit the industry in the long run. With only a few months until the FATFs adoption deadline, FINTRAC doesn’t have long to iron out the details."

On the other hand, Bitcoin research firm, Chaincode Labs, is the largest financial supporter of Bitcoin Core software development. The researchers note:“We conclude that the situation is more healthy than it has been in the past, with respect to the availability of finance, transparency, and the degree of distribution among financial backers.”BitMEX researchers used publicly available information and data obtained from the individuals involved to create what they believe is the most comprehensive picture of open source Bitcoin developer funding.According to the data, Blockstream and Lightning Labs both employ 8 developers to work on Bitcon, followed by Square Crypto which employs 7.

42140, Maze Hacker Group Claims Infecting Insurance Giant Chubb with Ransomware ,2020-03-29t18:00:00+01:00,5363,124,"Black hat hacker group, Maze, claims to have used ransomware to compromise the systems of insurance giant, Chubb. They also claim to have stolen the firm’s data.Brett Callow, threat analyst at cybersecurity firm, Emsisoft, told Cointelegraph on March 27 that Maze published the claim on its website. While the website does not provide any direct proof of the hack so far, Callow pointed out facts that give the claim an air of credibility:“Maze’s past victims include governments, law firms, healthcare providers, manufacturers, medical research companies, healthcare providers and more.”Maze’s modus operandiCallow explained that the group usually first claims the hacks after successful attacks and then — if the victim does not pay — they publish a small amount of the stolen data as proof of the hack. At this point, if the compromised entity still does not pay, Maze will start publishing more and more sensitive data:“Should the company still not pay, more data is published, sometimes on a staggered basis, to ramp up the pressure. In previous cases, the criminals have also published the data on Russian cybercrime forums with a note to ‘Use this information in any nefarious ways that you want.’ In one previous incident, the group demanded $1 million to decrypt a company’s data plus an additional $1 million to destroy the copy that had been stolen.”In February, Maze compromised five United States law firms and demanded two 100 Bitcoin ransoms in exchange for restoring data and deleting additional copies of their files. The ransom amount demanded from Chubb is not currently known.According to company data website, Owler, Chubb is an insurance provider headquartered in Zurich with 32,700 employees and an annual revenue of $34.2 billion. The firm did not answer Cointelegraph’s inquiry by press time.An organized hacker groupMaze is a particularly notorious and well-organized cybercriminal group. Callow also told Cointelegraph that “Maze was the first ransomware group to steal and publish data, and it is a strategy that other groups have since adopted.”Maze also publishes press releases on the same website where stolen data is published. Those announcements closely resemble the statements released by ordinary companies, although they often contain grammatical errors. In one such press release — published on March 22 — the group claims that it carries on its activities in an attempt to bring attention to the lack of cybersecurity. The release reads:“We want to show that the system is unreliable. The cybersecurity is weak. The people who should care about the security of the information are unreliable. We want to show that nobody cares about the users. [...] Some people like Julian Assange or Edward Snowden were trying to show the reality. Now it’s our turn. We will change the situation by making irresponsible companies pay for every data leak.”The announcement also promises that the public will hear more about successful attacks by the group in the future. In another announcement — dated March 18 — the Maze group also promised that firms they hack amid the pandemic will have right to a discount in the ransom:“Due to the situation with the incoming global economy crisis and virus pandemic, our Team decided to help commercial organizations as much as possible. We are starting an exclusive discount season for everyone who has faced our product. Discounts are offered for both decrypting files and deleting of the leaked data. To get the discounts our partners should contact us using the chat or our news resource.”As Cointelegraph recently reported, Maze also infected the systems of Hammersmith Medicines Research, a United Kingdom firm researching the coronavirus. Maze published sensitive data on its website including the results of medical tests and id documents, such as passports."
42138, Book Review - CoinGecko’s ‘How to DeFi’ ,2020-03-29t17:00:00+01:00,2203,91,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is certainly the buzz-phrase in the cryptocurrency world right now. But although we are hearing more and more about the potential of this technological breakthrough to revolutionize the world of traditional finance, many are still unsure of what DeFi actually involves.CoinGecko has just released its very first book, called ‘How to DeFi’. This book aims to provide an easy entry point for those wanting to learn about the subject.Why to DeFiAfter an obligatory slew of quotes from industry figures, recommending the book as the ideal starting point from which to enter the world of DeFi, we get straight into why it matters.With over $1 billion worth of assets locked into the DeFi ecosystem it is currently one of the fastest growing sectors in the cryptocurrency space. The most radical change that it promises to bring is the removal of a need for centralized institutions to control the financial system.The three areas in which DeFi currently aims to improve on centralized banking structures are cost and speed of remittance payments, providing financial services without censorship (including to the 1.7 billion global unbanked), and transparency of governance.After explaining what DeFi is, the book lists the categories of financial service currently available through it. From stablecoins, lending and borrowing, through exchanges, derivatives and fund management, to lotteries, payments and insurance, every aspect of the current DeFi ecosystem is covered.How to DeFiPart Two of the book explains the workings of the Ethereum network, as the most popular platform for DeFi applications. Smart contracts, Ether, and Gas are explained, before looking at the pros and cons of decentralized apps (Dapps).Finally, different wallet types are compared, with a step-by-step walkthrough of getting up and running on both mobile wallet Argent, and Metamask for desktop. All that done, we move on to Part Three, the deep dive.Each of the aforementioned categories of DeFi service are given a full chapter, focussing on one or two key providers in each case. We learn about stablecoins through the example of the MakerDAO platform, Compound is used to illustrate loans, decentralized exchanges (DEx) are explained using Uniswap and dYdX, and so on.Each chapter gives an overview of the services available, with diagrams helping to explain some of the trickier concepts. It then explains how the service works on the chosen example platform, along with a step-by-step guide for those who feel compelled to jump straight in.The target audience of the book is DeFi beginners, so some of the finer details of the chosen platforms are left out, but the level is generally pitched about right. Does a DeFi novice, for example, really need to know the intricacies of the Maker Protocol’s incentive scheme, or is the fact that it is soft-pegged to the dollar knowledge enough?Whether to readWhile the earlier chapters do a great job of leading a beginner into the world of DeFi, with a wealth of explanations and diagrams, later chapters seem to assume some existing knowledge of the subject.For example, the chapters on derivatives and fund management will be more useful to those who already understand these concepts in traditional finance. Although, it is perhaps wise not to encourage a beginner to let loose with leveraged derivatives trading, so that may not be a bad thing.The final challenge was the ‘Dad test’; i.e. could my father, a man in his seventies with only a very basic knowledge of cryptocurrency, gain a reasonable understanding of DeFi, simply through reading this book? I received this message when he was around 50 pages in:“... although I don’t understand everything I have enjoyed reading it. It is written in a very easy style that I think most people who are interested in the subject would be able to follow.”Of course, my dad isn’t exactly the book’s target audience, but he still found the information accessible, and felt that someone with a greater background knowledge of cryptocurrency would get more from it. He also liked the step-by-step walkthroughs showing how to perform certain functions on the platforms featured.The book is certainly well written and thoroughly researched, with links to references used, suggested further reading, and a glossary of terms at the very end.It is full of relevant and timely information, and is available for free download until April 30. The retail price after April 30 will be $14.99."

Several countries in Europe and the US have been the worst affected outside of China where the virus started. While the world attempts to tackle the spread of the virus by lockdowns, it is having a huge negative impact on the economy.In order to support the economy, the US announced a stimulus package of $2.2 trillion, which is the largest in history. Meanwhile, the Fed’s balance sheet continues to swell and has crossed $5 trillion in assets.While these efforts are a great morale booster in the short-term, they are likely to result in a financial crisis down the road, which cannot be handled just by printing more money. As the investors realize this, they are likely to enter the crypto space, which can not be manipulated by the governments at will.Crypto market data weekly view. Source: Coin360A user poll of “VIP” crypto traders on Kraken shows that the traders expect Bitcoin (BTC) to hit an average price of $22,866 by the end of this year. About half of the participants expect the SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF this year. It is not only Bitcoin that traders are positive on, but about 50% of the respondents also forecast an altcoin season for 2020.Another bullish indicator is that the total number of wallets holding a whole Bitcoin has reached 800,000. This is a positive sign as it shows that investors are using the current low prices to accumulate. Do the technicals of the top five performers of this week also show signs of accumulation? Let’s study the charts.CRO/USDCrypto.com Coin (CRO) has made it to the list of top performers for the second consecutive week. This shows that bulls continue to favor the altcoin. Crypto.com added Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to its Crypto Earn program, which will help investors earn up to 4% p.a. on their deposits, paid in BCH. Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ) were added to soft staking, which will help investors earn up to 2% p.a.Along with giving handsome interest rates, the payments and cryptocurrency platform announced collaborations with three tax providers to assist its users in cryptocurrency tax reporting.CRO USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe rebound from the recent lows of $0.0245 broke above the 20-week EMA at $0.045 but could not rise above the 50-week SMA at $0.049. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending the moving averages.Currently, the price has dipped back below the 20-week EMA, which shows selling at higher levels. The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This suggests a consolidation for the next few days. The CRO/USD pair might remain stuck between $0.050 and $0.0245.Our view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and plunges below the support at $0.0245. A breakdown of this level will be a huge negative as it will start a new downtrend.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $0.050, a rally to $0.060 and above it to $0.080 is possible.XMR/USDMonero (XMR) was the second-best performer of the past seven days with a rally of about 13%. It has made a sharp recovery in the past few days and is now attempting to find a place among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. What does its chart suggest? Let’s find out.XMR USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe sharp selling on March 12 and 13 plunged the XMR/USD pair below the critical support of $38.83. While a drop to a multi-year low is a huge negative, we like the way the price quickly recovered from the lows of $25.3118. This shows strong buying at lower levels.After two weeks of failed attempts by the bears to resume the downtrend, the pair started a relief rally this week. The bulls pushed the price above the first overhead resistance of $44.50, which is a positive sign.If the bulls can sustain the price above $44.50, the relief rally can extend to the 20-week EMA at $60.15 and above it to the 50-week SMA at $70.51. Therefore, the traders can turn positive if the price breaks above $52.On the downside, we expect the bulls to provide strong support at $38. However, if this level cracks, a retest of the recent low at $25.3118 is possible.XRP/USDXRP, with a rally of about 12%, turned out to be the third-best performer of the past seven days. This week saw two different groups of scammers targeting XRP users.The research team “xrplorer forensics” claimed that a fraudulent Google Chrome extension has allegedly stolen about 1.4 million XRP from the users. In another scam, a bogus YouTube account impersonating Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, was seen promoting a fake giveaway.However, on a positive note, Ripple Labs announced a donation of $100,000 each to two non-profit organizations to aid the fight against coronavirus.XRP USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe XRP/USD pair has broken out of the descending channel, which is a positive sign. This signals a possible change in trend.Currently, the bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the horizontal resistance of $0.17468. If successful, the pair might again dip towards the recent lows of $0.12750 and below it $0.1140.If the lows hold once again, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks. However, if the bears sink the price to new lows, it will be a huge negative.On the other hand, if the bulls can sustain the price above $0.17468, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The first level to watch out for is the 20-week EMA at $0.225 and if this is crossed, a move to $0.31503 is possible. The traders can wait for the pair to close (UTC time) above $0.17468 before turning positive.ADA/USDCardano (ADA) moved up by about 4% in the past seven days and took the fourth spot among the best performers. Cardano launched its off-chain scalability protocol, Ouroboros Hydra, which according to the company can “theoretically scale to a million transactions per second - comfortably in excess of current global payment systems such as VISA.”Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson criticized Wikipedia for not allowing an article in the English language for Cardano, though several other major cryptocurrencies have one.ADA USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe ADA/USD pair had been trading inside a large range of $0.03-$0.065 for the past few months. However, the recent sharp sell-off saw the price break below the range and dip to a low of $0.0176366.While a new multi-year low is a bearish sign, we like that the price did not stay near the lows for long. This shows that the bulls bought the dip instead of panicking and dumping their holdings.Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the price back above $0.030 but are struggling to sustain the price above it. This shows that the bears are unwilling to give up without a fight. The failure to sustain above $0.030 might attract another round of selling.If the next dip holds above the recent lows, we expect the pair to rise back above $0.030. If the price sustains above $0.030, a rally to $0.065 in the medium-term is possible. Though the 20-week EMA at $0.042 and the 50-week SMA at $0.053 might offer resistance, we expect them to be crossed. The traders can wait for the price to sustain above $0.030 before turning positive.XLM/USDStellar Lumens (XLM) was the fifth-best performer with a rally of just under 3%. Can the bulls carry the price higher or will the altcoin turn around and dip to new yearly lows? Let’s study its chart.XLM USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe XLM/USD pair is attempting to recover from its multi-year low of $0.026063. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They are aggressively defending the overhead resistance of $0.042133.If the price turns down from the current levels, the bears will once again attempt to start a new downtrend. A break below $0.026063 will be a huge negative.Conversely, if the pair climbs and sustains above $0.042133, it will signal that the recent breakdown was a bear trap. Above $0.042133, rising to the 20-week EMA at $0.056 and above it to the 50-week SMA at $0.075 is possible. The traders can wait for the price to sustain above $0.042133 before turning positive.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42135, DeFi Cannibalizes Ethereum Block Space ,2020-03-29t15:11:00+01:00,6720,112,"Data published by Ganesh Swami, the co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) analysis firm, Covalent, indicates that decentralized finance, or DeFi, transactions are representing an increasing share of Ethereum block space at the expense of ETH transfers.Swami analyzed the gas costs incurred by Ethereum transactions over time in order to estimate the share of network activity represented by ETH transfers, simple ERC-20 transactions, and the complex interactions with smart contracts usually associated withDeFI protocols — as each transactional category incurring progressively larger gas fees.DeFi transactions ‘cannibalize’ Ethereum block spaceSwami identifies what “seems to be a natural ceiling to the total gas consumed across all types of transactions,” indicating “the intense demand for block space of Ethereum” and the network’s “lack of scalability,” adding:“In an ideal scalable world, all types of transactions have room to grow. But on Ethereum today, for one kind of transaction to grow, it has to cannibalize the others.”When looking at the relative proportion of transactions represented by each of the three categories, the data shows a steady increase in the number of complex transactions at the expense of ETH and ERC-20 transfers — with complex transfers growing from roughly 5% of network activity at the start of 2017 to hover between 20% and 30% in recent months.Relative share of gas fees for each transactional category on Ethereum: CovalentThe graph also illustrates the rise and fall of initial coin offerings, with ERC-20 transfer accounting for 20% of network activity during early 2017. ERC-20 transactions would hover between 10% and 15% throughout the rest of 2017, before sliding as low as 5% by mid-2018.After a short bounce back up to 10% during the later months of 2018, ERC-20 transactions have consistently fallen — with ERC-20 transfers currently representing less than 5% of Ethereum network activity.Covalent predicts upcoming ‘flippening’ within EthereumSwami predicts that complex transactions will continue to represent a growing percentage of network activity as an increasing number of decentralized organizations (DAOs), games, and other applications for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) launch on Ethereum.As such, the analyst expects the trend will soon drive a ‘flippening’ in which complex transactions overtake ETH transfers."

Source: TradingViewOn a more bullish note for Bitcoin price, there is a seemingly valid ascending channel opening up, which might catch many off guard, as the resistance on the descending channel is the moving average of the descending channel.As such, $7,200 could be a critical turning point for the king of cryptocurrencies, which could lead to a new resistance level of $8,300.If this is the case, it would put support today around $6,060 and around the $6,100 level next week; and holding these levels would certainly be incredibly bullish for Bitcoin. And it’s not just the technicals that are strong either.Last week, gold-bug Peter Schiff sent a smug tweet addressing all Bitcoin holders that read:“Congratulations Bitcoin hodlers. It looks like #Bitcoin may actually be living up to its status as a non-correlated asset after all. Every asset class is rallying today except Bitcoin!”However, unknowingly to Schiff, he just made the most fundamentally bullish case for Bitcoin. As the global markets rising last week was a direct result of trillions of dollars being printed out of thin air, Bitcoin, however, doesn’t need “stimulus packages,” “quantitative easing” or “bailouts.”Bitcoin bounced back 80% from its recent bottom, showing that Bitcoin has something a lot more powerful than these things. It has believers in its value proposition.This to me is a great sign that Bitcoin will emerge from this global pandemic stronger than its ever been, but we might not be out of the woods just yet.The Weekly MACD isn’t bullish just yetBTC USD weekly MACD chart. Source: TradingViewOne of the best indicators for knowing when to buy or sell Bitcoin is the weekly Moving Average Divergence Convergence ( MACD) indicator. As can be seen from the chart above, it crossed bullish eight months before the all-time high (ATH) and crossed bearish a month after the ATH.It also crossed bullish when Bitcoin was at its bottom in Feb. 2019. However, there can be false crosses, and this is what I warned people of in my analysis on Dec. 8, 2019. Here I pointed out that the MACD was mimicking the patterns we saw around the last false bullish cross, which saw Bitcoin fall from over $8K to under $4K and as it happens, that’s exactly what happened again this month.As such, it would suggest that perhaps the MACD is telling us once more, that the bottom is in, and that now is the time to buy Bitcoin aggressively before the next bull-run.However, I would personally like to see the MACD and Signal lines pinching before getting too excited, but if the new ascending channel remains valid, then that is exactly what we will see happen.The bearish scenario for Bitcoin priceBTC mining difficulty. Source: BTC.comDespite all my bullishness, you cannot ignore that the Bitcoin mining difficulty had its biggest drop since December 2018, and it looks as if another big drop is on the cards for April.This could point to either more downside for Bitcoin, or it could be pointing for more profitability for miners, which would reinforce my theory on why miners crashed Bitcoin earlier this month. Should this have a detrimental effect on the price of Bitcoin, then this will invalidate the ascending support of $6,100 and put $5,600 and $4,100 as the levels to defend over the coming week.The bullish scenario for Bitcoin priceIf $6,100 support holds, then the next level to flip is $7,200.

42132, Cointelegraph Exclusive: Former CFTC Chair Looks to Digital Dollar Beyond COVID-19 Stimulus ,2020-03-29t13:57:00+01:00,4749,167,"The digital dollar has been the talk of the crypto world this week. Drafts of the COVID-19 stimulus bill first included and then discarded the creation of digital dollar wallets; a digital distribution method that would enable direct aid to citizens.The version of the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act” that became law on March 27 features no mention of the digital dollar. While the proposed digital dollar lives on in at least one bill sponsored by Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), a United States central bank digital currency (CBDC) seems like it will have to wait for now.The Digital Dollar ProjectThis week’s emergency legislation is not the first time that U.S. lawmakers have raised the prospect of a CBDC and will not be the last.Two notable advocates for a digital dollar are J. Christopher Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine. The pair worked together at the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), where Giancarlo served as Chair. Gorfine led the commission’s FinTech innovation office, LabCFTC.Both Giancarlo and Gorfine left the CFTC in the summer of 2019. They made headlines in October for an op-ed advocating a digital dollar and, subsequently, for their launch of the non-profit Digital Dollar Foundation in January.As the crypto world reacted to the prospect of the digital dollar envisioned by Congress, the Digital Dollar Project announced its inaugural advisory board.Cointelegraph spoke with Giancarlo and Gorfine about Congress’ recent interest in a digital dollar as well as their plans for the Digital Dollar Project.New legislation may be hasty, but project “heartened” to have people talkingThough the project had been part of conversations with policymakers, Giancarlo said the language surrounding a digital dollar in the recently proposed legislation was not from them. “We did not have anything to do with what was in the House bill,” he said.Giancarlo continued to explain that the digital dollar would be useful in a crisis, but its development will probably need more time than the current emergency aid demands:“The United States has to proceed thoughtfully, intelligently, deliberately. We advocate pilot programs as a way to explore the utilization of the digital dollar and how it can be used, including how it can be used in a crisis. But I think one needs to be very cautious about trying to launch something as big as this amidst a crisis.”Gorfine saw the task of distributing money to U.S. citizens in need of aid as a good use case for a digital dollar, but suggested that the present crisis might be too soon for such an implementation.“This crisis has demonstrated that some of our processes don't seem to match a 21st-century leading economy in terms of capabilities. It's not surprising that there's now focus on whether there are better, more efficient ways to go about moving funds,” explained Gorfine. “It's also important that pursuing something like this doesn't become a distraction from getting necessary funds out in a really expedient fashion.”Both thought that the current dilemma would at least get people talking about a digital dollar. According to Giancarlo:“It's clear that as the public sector talks about seeking to find ways to get money into people's hands efficiently, effectively, quickly, and also to get money in the hands of people who are either underbanked or unbanked, the value of a digital dollar becomes quite clear as a delivery mechanism.”Broad ambitions for bringing the dollar into the 21st centuryEven if the current stimulus doesn’t see any new forms of aid distribution, the digital dollar project plans to see its broader goals through.Not aiming to publish a white-paper or push any particular coding agenda, Giancarlo and Gorfine still see a broad reboot of the dollar as necessary if it is to remain vital into the 21st century. Giancarlo said:“The dollar's preeminence as a reserve currency is based upon it being a unit of account for most of the world's things of value — commodities, currencies, benchmarks — and all of those are going through a digitization revolution. And we really believe the dollar needs to go through a digitization as well.”Gorfine was similarly taken with the prospect of money transforming for the internet age:“Just as today, we can send an email with information halfway around the world in a fairly frictionless and efficient way with relatively few intermediaries — the same now seems to be true with sending information about value and about specific or unique ownership over value. The idea that we've been able to move that information more efficiently from one computer effectively to another with fewer or at least different types of intermediaries seems to be a real trend that's going to impact all aspects of financial markets and services. And to that end money is not immune.”Technological remains undeterminedThe project remains uncertain as to specific technologies, with its founders still hesitant to say what sort of blockchain it would run on, or any other technical specifications. They described the project’s mission as more dedicated to providing information on potential technical trade-offs.Gorfine said the task at hand was to get to work:“Kicking the tires to find out what some of the potential benefits could be, what some of the challenges will be, how you design this, and what are the tradeoffs based on those design choices.”Regarding the appearance of the language “digital dollar” in recent bills and the uncertainty as to whether this would be a blockchain-based CBDC, Giancarlo gave a more nuanced explanation of the Digital Dollar Project’s terminology:“We’ve been using the phrase ‘digital dollar’ quite consistently to refer to a US central bank digital currency. While other people say, ‘well the dollar’s already digital’ — it is indeed electronic, but when we refer to digital dollars we refer to something that is tokenized, has the full faith and credit of the United States government and is minted and distributed the same way that fiat is minted and distributed through the existing financial market banking infrastructure.”The Digital Dollar Project, as the pair laid out in current objectives, is aiming to promote comprehensive pilot programs to figure out the real-world implications of different technical options.Relationship to potential competitorsOne question that arises when talking about a U.S. Fed-backed digital currency is what would happen to the many existing digital assets pegged to the dollar, including Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC or Binance’s BUSD. The United States is a notoriously tricky jurisdiction for many crypto firms to operate within anyway. Would the government try to suppress use of these preexisting stablecoins if they were to compete with an official digital dollar? Or, more simply, would demand for such coins shift?Gorfine denied that the project’s proposed digital dollar would compete with existing stablecoins: “There are big differences when you're talking about a central bank digital currency, which is a central bank liability, as opposed to tokenization of bank money, which is something you see more with stablecoin projects. They're certainly not intended to be competitive with one another.”Many governments have looked to CBDCs as ways of modernizing their money. The European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have shown interest in the prospect. Sweden and the Bahamas seem well on their way to developing, respectively, an e-krona and a sand dollar. China’s digital renminbi seems to be the biggest direct competitor or even threat to the United States.Giancarlo and Gorfine said that they had been following the development of China’s CBDC, but declined to view it as a competitor. “The Digital Dollar Project takes no view on the development of other either competing central bank digital currencies or cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. It just proposes that it's in the U.S.'s interest to create a central bank digital currency,” said Giancarlo. He continued to elaborate on the unique approaches different governments take in their major projects:“We have a view that if you look at development of CBDCs around the world, they’re all driven in ways that are appropriate to their national characteristics. When China does something big, whether that’s build a blue-water navy or to develop a digital Yuan, it’s driven by the Communist Party. When Europeans do something big, it’s generally driven by the public sector. When we in America do something big, whether it’s land a man on the moon or build the internet, it’s always done in a public-private partnership. We think something as big as the digital dollar should be built in a public-private partnership.”The international user question standsCointelegraph has previously asked the question of whether a digital dollar — especially one issued by the Fed and administered by Fed-member banks — would be able to operate outside of the United States. The language of recent bills promoting a digital dollar didn’t seem conscious of the prospect.Giancarlo, for one, wanted to see the digital dollar functional outside of the United States. “What we propose would be a true central bank digital currency that would be utilized in international commerce as well as domestic commerce,” he said.Cross-border payments, including remittances from workers sending money to families in other countries, is one of the major arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies at large. According to Gorfine, the Digital Dollar Project would like to streamline that process. He said:“There are three large categories of potential use cases when you talk about a U.S. CBDC. You've got kind of a retail payment use case or application. You've got a wholesale market. And then you've got international payments, which includes remittances.”Conclusion? TimeAs with much of the rest of the conversation, Gorfine and Giancarlo took the long view. Rather than tacking on a digital dollar to an ongoing emergency, they wanted to see pilot programs to test how cross-border payments, financial inclusion, and other issues facing the digital dollar would play out in controlled environments.Those of us interested in the fate of a digital dollar will just have to wait to see whether its recent brief appearance in landmark legislation will propel longer-term initiatives favoring it forward, or whether legislators will shelve the issue until the next catastrophe."
42131, What Will Be the Early Privacy Impact of Secure Multiparty Computation? ,2020-03-29t12:23:00+01:00,2157,91,"Currently, one of the most rigorously examined corners of the surging cryptography space, secure multiparty computation, or sMPC, is widely considered a viable solution to many practical situations in the real world. The concept has some promising implications ranging from privacy to scalability and efficiency, and it’s lasting impact lay outside the purview of only blockchain technology.However, many crypto and blockchain platforms are among the early pioneers in actively applying the technology to finance, advertising, insurance and other industries.“The beauty of multi-party protocols is that they use a rich body of tools and sub-protocols, some of which have been developed especially for MPC and others previously developed for the cryptographic non-distributed setting,” detailed Dragos Rotaru, a researcher for the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, in the team’s white paper.The rich feature-set of tools includes the lauded protocols of zero-knowledge proofs, message authentication codes, commitment schemes and secret sharing models, like Shamir’s Secret Sharing. The compatibility of sMPC with such blossoming cryptography subfields, along with its recent development that surpassed many of its performance limitations, is poised to unleash a new suite of features for many public blockchains, financial applications and data sharing.Related: Secure Encryption Key Management Modules, ExplainedA brief history and introduction of sMPCsThe concept of sMPCs gained traction in the early 1980s as a solution to “Yao’s Millionaire Problem.” The problem is a classic example of two parties, Alice and Bob, wishing to determine which party is wealthier without revealing their explicit wealth value.The goal of sMPC is to enable both Alice and Bob to compute a function over the shared inputs — e.g., their wealth — without revealing the value of the inputs. As a result, the counterparties can discern which is wealthier without exposing private financial data. Contrary to most cryptographic goals, sMPC protects participating user privacy from one another and is not explicitly created to protect a communication channel from third-party snooping.The applications of sMPC are numerous, but its early potential was handcuffed by its performance limitations. Those handcuffs have been removed. As the ARPA white paper details:“With theoretical constructions going back 35 years, there are substantial improvements in algorithmic and engineering designs over the past decade to improve performance.”ARPA references that the overall performance of sMPCs has increased by four to five orders of magnitude in the last decade alone — which are drastic improvements. As a result, the applications of sMPCs are no longer relegated to theoretical designs and are now firmly planted in the practical world.For example, sMPCs can play the primary role in mitigating one of crypto’s most endemic problems — exchange transparency. Endeavors like Blockstream’s Bitcoin proof-of-reserves attempt to self-regulate exchange treasuries to ensure customers that their deposits are fully-backed by the exchange. Instances like the QuadrigaCX debacle would fade away, and exchanges would garner more regulatory trust in the process.The sentiment for better exchange reserve transparency is also consistently touted by Castle Island Ventures’s Nic Carter, who views the progression as inevitable. And while PoR protocols like the one from Blockstream still need to improve privacy, others, such as ARPA’s, are on the cusp of bolstering the prospects of PoR significantly. The ARPA MPC network is in its pre-Alpha mainnet stage. Users can stake their tokens, join the privacy-preserving computation network, complete tasks and get computation rewards.In addition, institutional and personal account key management requirements stimulated by distributed ledgers have also spawned many wallet applications, and this change has also affected traditional enterprises. No matter in the blockchain or traditional financial institutions, the threshold signature scheme enabled by sMPC can bring security and privacy improvements in various scenarios.Wallets based on a threshold signature are more secure because the private key doesn’t need to be rebuilt. Also, without all signatures posted publicly, anonymity can be achieved. Compared to the multi-signature, a threshold signature needs lower transaction fees. Similar to key management applications, the administration of digital asset accounts can also be more flexible. Furthermore, a threshold signature wallet can support various blockchains that do not natively support multi-signature, which reduces the risk of smart contract bugs.The remaining barriers to the proliferation of sMPC hinge on education and making the technology more accessible. For example, developers are working on abstracting away the underlying complexity of the technology and building “plug-and-play” setups for businesses to tap into the technology. As Rotaru continued:“Our goal is to build an MPC network with high availability for the first time where any business needs for secure computation can be conducted on the network or by using smart contracts on existing blockchains such as Ethereum or EOS.”By reducing the costs and barriers to access sMPCs, businesses can leverage one of cryptography’s most venerated achievements. However, the direct impact on sMPCs extends beyond PoR for exchanges well into the depths of the battle for digital privacy.Privacy advantages of sMPCApplications can be layered on top of sMPC protocols, masking the exceptional complexity that underscores them — something businesses do not want to pay for to implement themselves. Once the barriers to accessing sMPC protocols are reduced, the practical applications for privacy become pretty obvious.The primary target area? Privacy.For example, outside the scope of blockchains, imagine any scenario where two or more parties want to come together; they do not explicitly trust each other and would like to determine an outcome without revealing sensitive internal details about each other.Situations like data sharing, such as calculating the average age of a group of web users visiting a website without exposing other (non-pertinent) personal user data, immediately come to mind. Others, like insurance providers analyzing risk without having to control vast quantities of data (no more Equifax hacks), are also enticing. And some, like secure monetization for user data by renting personal data to advertisers, might be the tip of the privacy spear that shatters the glass ceiling of user privacy abuse.ARPA views sMPC as also playing a critical role in health care, an industry rife with data privacy and security problems.“Individual medical data contains sensitive information that is risky to run a diagnosis using third-party models or tools,” says Rotaru. He added:“With sMPC protocols, such as ARPA’s, medical data for diagnoses can be computed without leaking data to third-party model providers, specifically AI specialists that are prevailing as pivotal algorithmic providers to medical institutions.”Related: What Are zk-SNARKs and How Do They Affect Digital Privacy?It’s unlikely that enterprises will recognize the advent of sMPCs to their advantage in the short-term. Their incorporation of the technology will likely follow its proven accolades among public blockchains, and specifically, financial applications running on those networks. Enterprises that have been investing in both researching and implementation of sMPC have also come together to form an alliance to bring global awareness to this technology. The MPC Alliance now has over a dozen members.Yet, the question is whether or not the technology will become more sophisticated from this point forward:Should the technology become a ubiquitous, accessible tool on the web, expect an entire generation of companies to provide privacy services to web surfers, advertisers and companies with data-intensive requirements?The trajectory of sMPC’s impact on privacy appears inevitably fruitful in the long-term. Now, the onus is on crypto companies and blockchains to tinker and promote the technology that has cryptographers so excited about the future of privacy.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Andrew Rossow is a millennial attorney, law professor, entrepreneur, writer and speaker on privacy, cybersecurity, AI, AR/VR, blockchain and digital currencies.

Survey responses are publicly posted to the Algorand blockchain to allow permanent open access to the data.Respondents are not able to change or remove the information that they share and are encouraged to repeatedly update their answers as their condition changes. As such, individuals who do not have the virus are encouraged to participate and update their answers if their status changes.The survey asks for basic information — such as age, gender, and location, in addition to confirming if respondents have exhibited or been tested or treated for COVID-19, and whether they have entered into self-isolation.Algorand to release data analysis tools for repositoryAlgorand will publish aggregate statistics and launch tools for analyzing the database as data is compiled from the survey. Dr. Tal Rabin, the head of research at the Algorand Foundation, emphasizes that “the need for information is one of the key requirements in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.” He added:“Very little information is coming directly from the people in the community. I hope more people in the world will respond to the questionnaires in our app so that we can gather meaningful information.”Coronavirus relief efforts from crypto industry proliferateAlgorand’s survey comes amid an increasing number of coronavirus relief campaigns engineered by major players within cryptocurrency.On March 25, Cointelegraph reported that Binance Charity had launched a global fundraising campaign to distribute medical supplies across the nations hardest hit by coronavirus.

Partly driven by a massive boom in interest caused by Bitcoin’s stellar bull run in 2017, blockchain technology quickly became the new catchword in tech. A swathe of startups entered the fray during that period as entrepreneurs looked to cash in on the hype in the space.Bigger companies that weren’t looking into the benefits of the technology faced the risk of being left behind and began to carefully explore solutions to their own business mechanisms. Others had already begun exploring the potential benefits that blockchain could bring to various systems. That included some of the biggest names in the tech space, including IBM, Samsung, Google, Sony and Apple.IBMAmerican tech giant IBM has made waves in the space for filing a multitude of patents that use blockchain technology. The company has been a leader in adoption since 2014, putting it well ahead of most when it comes to developing and using blockchain-based solutions.One of IBM’s earliest forays into the technology was exploring the capabilities of blockchain technology to power the Internet of Things. The Address Energy in Parallel Technologies project, or ADEPT, was born in collaboration with Samsung, which allowed domestic appliances to autonomously interact with its environment.The project’s use case was proved by a Samsung washer autonomously ordering its own detergents and replacement parts. The ADEPT concept used Telehash for communication, BitTorrent powered its file sharing, and the Ethereum blockchain was used for functions that required more in-depth contract capabilities.The company’s most defining work came in 2015 with the launch of the IBM Blockchain. The platform is built on the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric — which IBM contributed to developing alongside a host of other companies.The IBM Blockchain is an enterprise blockchain solution aimed at large scale businesses and corporations. The platform allows users to join existing blockchains or even create new platforms suited to their needs. The IBM website estimates that it has over 500 live, working blockchain projects. These projects cover a broad spectrum of industries, including trade finance, supply chains and identity services.Notable blockchain projects include supply chain management platform TradeLens, which was developed by shipping giants Maersk together with IBM. The system tracks real-time data of shipping transactions and progress in a permissioned network.Related: Walmart’s Foray Into Blockchain, How Is the Technology Used?IBM’s Food Trust Blockchain is another notable platform that has onboarded some major conglomerates over the past two years. The blockchain-based food tracking platform is being used by the likes of Nestle and Unilever, as well as America’s leading retailer, Walmart.MicrosoftSince its inception back in 1975, Microsoft has been a leader in the IT and technology spheres. It’s operating systems have made it famous, but the company has branched out to provide a wide range of technology goods and services. Blockchain technology has not gone unnoticed by the company either. Although like IBM, it has focused on the development of private enterprise solutions as opposed to open-source, decentralized blockchains.Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service is the backbone of its move into the space and allows businesses to build and manage applications to improve a wide variety of internal and external services. A branch of the platform is the Azure Blockchain Service, which allows users to create their own consortium networks and applications using prebuilt networks and software.The Azure Blockchain Workbench allows developers to deploy a network, using existing infrastructure that is touted to reduce the amount of development time it would take to create an in-house solution. This includes automatic ledger deployment, network construction and pre-built blockchain commands.The platform has been employed by a number of companies around the world. American coffee company Starbucks deploys the Azure Blockchain platform to track coffee beans from its source farmers to its many stores around the world.Global aviation company GE Aviation also uses the Azure Blockchain service to record and track the details of aviation parts. The process has traditionally been done on paper, which is both time consuming and costly. The likes of Singapore Airlines, the Nasdaq, 3M and Xbox have used the Azure Blockchain platform for various offerings as well.SamsungSouth Korean tech giant Samsung has played an interesting role in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space for a number of reasons. Samsung is a major player in the electronics manufacturing industry in particular, and this has also spilled over into the cryptocurrency sector. The company is among the top producers of smartphones and semiconductors — two products that are actively used by crypto enthusiasts.Samsung’s processors became highly sought after during Bitcoin’s bull run in 2017, as users flocked to buy ASIC cryptocurrency miners. From the beginning of 2018, the company began designing and creating ASIC chips specifically designed for mining.Samsung also integrated cryptocurrency support into its smartphones in 2019 with the launch of the Blockchain Keystore application market. The major application launched was a password wallet for users' private keys. The functionality was rolled out with Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphones and is now supported on six of its devices, including the S10e, S10, S10+, S10 5G, Note10 and Note10+. A number of blockchain-based applications have been made available on the Blockchain Keystore since, and the Galaxy S10 smartphone now supports an even greater number of cryptocurrencies.Last but not least, Samsung SDS, the company’s IT arm, has also joined the fray in the enterprise blockchain space. The platform was launched in 2017 and competes with the likes of IBM and Microsoft’s enterprise blockchain solutions. The blockchain platform allows businesses to create and manage their own services for payments, supply chains, identity credentials and smart contracts.SonyJapanese IT firm Sony is well known for its electronics, but it’s made some interesting moves utilizing blockchain technology. The company has taken a slightly different approach in its appraisal of the possibilities of the technology and has earmarked areas that would benefit the most — education, music rights and sampling.In 2017, Sony announced that it was exploring a pilot project with Fujitsu to record and manage educational subject matter, records and grades using the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric. The platform allows educational institutions to virtually store and share academic learning records for individuals in a cryptographically secure, distributed blockchain network.This allows educational institutions or companies to have access to verified, tamper-proof educational records of the respective applicant or student. Conversely, it allows students and academics to have real-time access to their own academic records.Sony has also identified an interesting use for AI and blockchain technology in the music industry. According to their Soundmain description page, Sony began to make inroads in a particularly challenging space for artificial intelligence around 2013. In the field of sound and music production, differentiating different instruments and sounds in music is incredibly difficult for machines — it is a uniquely human capability.However, Sony’s developments in AI have led to some breakthroughs in audio separation technology. Its Soundmain platform enables users to separate different sounds into multiple channels from source audio that has already been mixed down to single or double channels.The software is intended to be used as a remixing and audio rights tool. Artists would be able to record a full set live and use the software to identify and mix the different instruments into individual sound channels afterward. Blockchain technology comes in to address issues around the rights to different music samples, enabling composers or individual musicians to be compensated if their samples are used by other production studios.Google, Apple maintain distanceGoogle and Apple are undisputed giants in the IT space, but both companies have kept blockchain technology and anything specifically related to cryptocurrencies at an arm’s length over the years. Both companies have copped criticism from the cryptocurrency community for their tough stance toward decentralized applications that are listed on the Google Play and Apple App stores. In response, the companies said that they act in the interest of safeguarding users from malware.The harsh stance has seen major exchanges like Coinbase have its cryptocurrency wallet DApp removed from the Apple Store over unresolved issues pertaining to developer guidelines. As recently as the beginning of March 2020, Google Play has even removed the applications of various cryptocurrency news platforms, including Cointelegraph’s app. Google had previously removed a plethora of cryptocurrency mining apps from the Play store.Nevertheless, Google has provided infrastructure assistance to cryptocurrency software firm Blockchain.com. The company uses Google’s Cloud service to handle its various databases for its Blockchain Wallet and Explorer services. The platform handles an enormous amount of data across various databases and has switched over to Google’s Cloud Spanner to streamline its processes.Meanwhile, Apple announced the development of the CryptoKit framework in 2019 that was initially met with much fanfare from the cryptocurrency community. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, the hype around the project was somewhat unjustified once the company gave some clarity into the project.The CryptoKit tool allows developers to carry out a variety of cryptographic operations. This includes the use of public-key cryptography to create and manage digital signatures. The software effectively allows developers to improve authentication and encryption services to improve security."
42128, Global Crypto Community Comes Out in Full Force Against Coronavirus ,2020-03-29t08:43:00+01:00,4785,285,"With cases of the deadly coronavirus still popping up at an unprecedented rate around the world, many prominent members of the blockchain and crypto industries have heeded the global cry for help and have swiftly engaged in meaningful action — be it in terms of direct research-related participation, or through the donation of funds or resource materials, such as masks, sanitization equipment, etc.For example, as early as January, premier cryptocurrency exchange Binance had already donated $1.4 million worth of medical supplies to Chinese authorities in a massive effort to combat the devastating effects of the coronavirus. Dubbed as the “Binance for Wuhan” project, the effort has seen the crypto trading platform donate a total of 366,000 pairs of gloves, 56,800 masks, 9 sterilizers, 5,280 bottles of hand sanitizer, 20,000 testing kits, 7,850 protective suits, 20,000 pairs of goggles, 388 oxygen concentrators, 1,000 germicidal lamps and roughly five tons of disinfectant.According to Jarred Winn, senior vice president of Binance Charity — the exchange’s social outreach wing — seven batches of medical supplies have reached 124 hospitals, medical teams and command wings. The germicidal lamps were sent to Wuhan University People’s Hospital and then distributed to 74 medical teams and health centers, as well as the hotels that accommodated the medical teams.Winn further told Cointelegraph that the germicidal lamps have the ability to produce ultraviolet light that can result in the deactivation of bacteria, viruses and protozoa, providing a clean living and working environment for the medical teams.Additionally, Binance Charity has also embarked on a new initiative wherein the company is looking to raise a total of $5 million in cryptocurrencies to acquire essential medical items for all of the countries that have been affected the most by the COVID-19 crisis. In this regard, a bulk of the funds will be used to quickly disseminate key medical equipment and supplies across countries like Italy, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Iran, Turkey, the United States and the United Kingdom.Commenting on the developing coronavirus situation, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, was quoted as saying: “We encourage the community to take part in this initiative as we unite against COVID-19, and together, we’ll drive impact.”On the role that blockchain technology has been playing in helping Binance with its aforementioned efforts, Winn told Cointelegraph that a long-lasting dilemma related to charity has been the question of “Where did my money go?” In regard to this point, he added:“With blockchain technology, transparency and immutability allow any user to see that funds have been transferred to an individual with 100% certainty, and subsequently, in this case, there are no secrets in giving.”Some notable effortsThe Giving BlockRecently, non-profit fundraising platform The Giving Block launched a crypto donation drive to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to The Giving Block Co-Founder Alex Wilson, the #cryptoCOVID19 alliance is being facilitated in partnership with Gitcoin — an open-source bounties platform on the Ethereum blockchain. In this regard, Wilson told Cointelegraph that Gitcoin and Vitalik Buterin will be matching donations up to $100,000 made in Ether (ETH), Dai (DAI) and ERC-20s. He further commented:“In total, there are over 20 industry partners helping support our efforts, each contributing in a unique way. For example, another one of our partners, Brave, is providing free ad inventory as part of their ad grants program to help drive traffic and awareness to the #cryptoCOVID19 campaign page.”Wilson also pointed out that donations made through The Giving Block’s official widget will go directly to the aforementioned nonprofits — with each of these entities having its very own institutional Gemini account on the backend so that incoming funds are directly passed to the beneficiaries. Lastly, while donations are possible via a host of digital assets, Wilson told Cointelegraph that a vast majority of the funds that have been received up until now have come in the form of Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, DAI and Zcash (ZEC).COVIDathonThe Decentralized AI Alliance, or DAIA, recently launched #COVIDathon, the world’s first decentralized artificial intelligence hackathon that has been designed to help assist the global medical industry in creating solutions to combat COVID-19.The alliance currently has more than 50 members from the blockchain space, including SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, Aragon, Shivom, NEM, InboundJunction, as well as communities of health care professionals, biotechnologists and geneticists.Cointelegraph spoke to Ben Goertzel, chairman of DAIA and the CEO and founder of SingularityNET. In his view, the current global pandemic is confronting the masses at large with a lot of ‘unknown unknowns,’ and thus in the face of such radical uncertainty, Goertzel believes that the crypto community as a whole must launch into action immediately. Talking about COVIDathon in more detail, he added:“The COVIDathon AI/blockchain hackathon is pulling together a diverse global group of AI and blockchain developers, medical and policy researchers, forming a community capable of creating and deploying new tools with the responsiveness and creativity demanded by a situation that is constantly changing.”Goertzel hopes that the community will come up with innovations, such as new apps for monitoring the health of individuals and communities, discovering new approaches for simulating the spread of COVID-19, in addition to developing new machine learning tools to help biomedical and epidemiological analysis, and many others.Additionally, Bruce Pon, one of COVIDathon’s key participants and co-founder of Ocean Protocol, told Cointelegraph that even though a whole lot of people are currently willing to compromise their privacy to ensure the safety of the masses, such a mindset should not become the new norm. In Pon’s view, COVIDathon will showcase useful, real-world applications that will look to give individuals more control when governments ask to surveil and track people to defeat the coronavirus.Ripple LabsOn March 25, Ripple Labs issued a tweet stating that the organization has donated a total of $200,000 to two separate non-profit organizations — namely, the Tipping Point Community and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The money is primarily aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States since a host of new data has shown that the total number of confirmed cases in the country is now higher than the number of reported cases in China.San Francisco-based Tipping Point Community is a non-profit organization that recently launched its Emergency Response Fund, through which it seeks to raise a total of $1 million for the COVID-19 response initiative. Similarly, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation’s COVID Regional Response Fund will focus more on the containment of COVID-19 within the Silicon Valley region.UAE’s MOCDAccording to a recent report, a number of international blockchain firms have come together to help minimize the spread of the virus, as well as prevent future outbreaks across the United Arab Emirates — mainly through the use of distributed database-related solutions.In this regard, the UAE’s Ministry of Community Development has already initiated the use of various digital platforms to streamline its government’s services. For example, a blockchain system that is reportedly capable of processing 2,919 types of documents is currently live — thus allowing citizens to authenticate their official certificates and other paperwork online without having to step out of their homes.Speaking on her country’s latest lockdown measures, Hessa Essa Buhumaid, UAE’s minister of community development, was quoted as saying that the “step confirms the ministry’s commitment to ensure the continuity and flexibility of all government services in light of the directives of the smart government to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”Napoli Blockchain AssociationThe Napoli Blockchain Association recently launched a crypto fundraiser to help combat the coronavirus by purchasing a host of electromedical equipment to strengthen Italy’s health care sector — specifically within the nation’s Campania region.Italy has been one of the worst-hit countries of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with Iran, the U.S., Spain and China. What is most striking is that the recent virus outbreak is putting an exceptionally heavy load on the Italian health care system — a country that was touted to have one of the best medical infrastructures in the world.Providing his thoughts on the matter, Napoli Blockchain Association President Celestino Santagata said that he and his team will use the raised funds to acquire specific equipment, such as ventilators and vital medicines to help those in need.MateonBlockchain driven immuno-oncology company Mateon released a report on March 25 claiming to have successfully completed positive testing for multiple COVID-19 drug candidates. Per the release, one of the company’s formulations — the OT-101, a TGF-Beta antisense drug — seems to have displayed significant effect against COVID-19.From a technical standpoint, it appears as though the drug works by inhibiting the virus from binding to its target, thus preventing the virus from replicating and infecting its host with pneumonia-related symptoms. In the wake of these promising developments, Vuong Trieu, president and CEO of Mateon, was quoted:“We are excited about our platform for rapid response against viral epidemics and look forward to working with GMP to further expand on that platform in the U.S. and China.”Folding Home (F@H)Folding@Home is a digital platform that has been designed to help provide medical researchers with adequate computational power to help them with their investigative efforts. The project has gained a lot of mainstream traction over the past month or so, with Greg Bowman, director of F@H, revealing that the project now has over 400,000 computers actively contributing their processing capacity to help with the aforementioned research efforts.Additionally, Folding@Home has also been able to garner the support of various big-name players, such as Tezos, a multipurpose blockchain platform, and CoreWeave, a company offering affordable and scalable machine learning on NVIDIA GPUs.In unity, there is strengthDespite the mass destruction — both economic and social — that has occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many silver linings that have come through in this time of need. For example, a number of prominent individuals operating within the private sector, entertainment and sports industry have come forth and made huge contributions to aid research, as well as provide essential supplies to those currently affected by the coronavirus.Even though the virus sadly continues to spread and with the efforts taken by a number of governments across the globe, it seems as though there might be some respite waiting right around the corner for everyone."
42127, Bitcoins on the Move — Is BTC Price Inversely Correlated to Mempool Size? ,2020-03-29t02:18:00+01:00,12075,109,"After making a strong recovery from $3,775 to $6,450, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has traded in a tight range which has seen the price struggle to push above resistance at $6,400 and $6,850. Despite the current pullback, technical indicators like the Stock-to-Flow model and the network’s consistent growth in hash rate show that investors have regained a small amount of confidence.Another factor worth considering is Bitcoin’s mempool size as it also can provide some insight into how buyers and sellers are reacting during these uncertain times.Cryptocurrency market weekly overview. Source: Coin360The mempool is where all the unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions wait until all confirmations are released to conclude each transaction. The higher the mempool size, the longer it takes for transactions to be confirmed since more blocks have to be confirmed (more power input).If a jam occurs in the memory pool due to an abnormal size of transaction waiting to be confirmed, the higher the probability to incur in a higher transaction fee to expedite it promptly.Bitcoin’s mempool size reached a record-high value at over 130MB/block during January 2018, days after Bitcoin price slightly crossed its all-time high at $20,000.Bitcoin Mempool size (in MB/Block) since June 2016-March 2020. Source: Blockchain.comThis could suggest a relationship between the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed and Bitcoin's price. If that is the case, the relationships would be inverse in times of corrections such as the one investors are facing now.2020 shows an inverse relationship in Bitcoin mempool size and priceConsidering a period from Feb. 19 until March 13, when Bitcoin lost 60%, we find that the correlation between the Bitcoin mempool size and its price is negative at -41.2%. This is a very high relationship considering that this correlation for the entire 2020 period available is almost non-significant at 2.34%.A correlation of 100% means that the Bitcoin price and the mempool size move completely in the same direction, while -100% correlation means they are inversely related. A correlation of 0% means that the variables are not related in any way.Current activity mirrors 2016In correction periods during 2016, where Bitcoin lost more than 20% in price, we find the same negative relationship between the mempool size and Bitcoin price, even though both have a high difference in values — one period is very inversely correlated (-83.1%) and the other period very slightly negative (-4.6%).In the six periods where a correction of up to a 20% decrease in price during 2017 and 2018, we find an inconclusive relationship across the correlations and this makes it impossible to reach a solid conclusion.Correlation between Bitcoin price and its mempool size for different correction periods during 2017However, if we look closely at the two periods that occurred during the second half of 2017 when Bitcoin ended up reaching its record price, both periods show an inverse relationship between the mempool size and Bitcoin price.Between Nov. 8 and Nov. 12, this relationship was very negative (-85.9%), while between Dec. 17 and Dec. 25, the correlation is very small (-5.6%).Correlation between Bitcoin price and its mempool size during 2018 correction periodsPositive relationship in 2019During 2019, four out of the five correction periods identified showed a positive correlation between the Bitcoin mempool size and its price, except for the last periods, which showed a slight negative correlation.Correlation between Bitcoin price and its mempool size during 2019Positive correlation in full-year periodsWhen considering the relationship during each year instead of only analyzing the corrective periods, we find a clear trend and a positive correlation between the mempool size and Bitcoin’s price.Moreover, a high correlation is seen in 2017 (80.8%) and 2018 (72.2%), despite not being able to draw a conclusive trend when analyzing the correction periods within those years. The positive trend, although small in magnitude, is also seen between both variables in 2016 (26.3%) and 2019 (9.5%). While in 2020, the relationship is practically non-existent (2.34%).“There is so much BTC in transit”Last week, there has been an increase in the mempool size even as Bitcoin’s price is going down. Looking forward, we may see the continuation of this inverse relationship contributes to the uncertainty of Bitcoin’s price in the short-term.As Cointelegraph markets analyst filbfilb recently pointed out:“I just can’t be long while I know there is so much BTC in transit.”The amount of Bitcoin possibly being moved into and out of exchanges in the last week’s raises further doubts about the inverse relationship between the mempool and Bitcoin price.Data for the mempool size drawn from Blockchain.com and prices from coinmarketcap.com.

42125, Ethereum-Based Social Video Network Integrates Zoom for Live Streaming ,2020-03-29t05:00:00+01:00,8809,145,"The Ethereum-based social media app, Pepo, has integrated with video conferencing platform, Zoom, to facilitate live streaming.Pepo Live Events is currently exclusively available in beta on the platform’s website and has not given an estimate for when it plans to enable mobile functionality.Pepo integrates Zoom for live streamingOnly Pepo community admins are able to stream live, however, anyone can participate in the live events. All events streamed on the platform are recorded, and are limited to a time limit of three hours.Pepo's decision to integrate Zoom suggests an increase in demand for live streaming services amid the coronavirus lockdown.The social app launched last October at DevCon 5. Pepo uses the OST platform to allow users to reward one another in its native Pepo token — an ERC-20 that is pegged 1:1 with OST tokens (OST).Coronavirus lockdown provides boon to video conferencing platformsWith so many people spending time at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing platforms have experienced booms in both users and share prices.However, many perhaps not-so-savvy pandemic investors have failed to do the basic research when seeking exposure to Zoom ($ZM) — with flocks of traders mistakenly placing bets on the unrelated gaming firm, Zoom Technologies ($ZOOM).The confusion drove Zoom Technologies’ up 700% in roughly one month before the New York Securities and Exchange Commission halted $ZOOM on March 27.In response to the SEC action, Twitter user ADPOY1 responded to the SEC’s action, stating: “When trading is resumed the dump is going to be epic.”Zoom Comes Under Fire for Weak PrivacyThe surge in Zoom’s use has been accompanied by increased scrutiny from security researchers — with nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) publishing a warning to users of the video conferencing platform on March 19.The EFF warns that Zoom administrators are able to access detailed information on the platform’s users, including full access to the video, audio, and chat transcripts of all calls made using the software that are recorded by its users."

Farmers can also track their produce as it moves through the supply chain on a per-crate basis — reducing the risk of theft and corruption.Overstock CEO and Medici Ventures president, Jonathan Johnson, describes the partnership between Medici’s keiretsu companies as “working to eliminate middlemen, democratize capital, and re-humanize commerce through the use of blockchain technology.”14,000 farmers currently use GrainChainThe firm claims that roughly 14,000 farmers currently use its smart contacts — including nearly 1,300 U.S. based users, almost 900 in Mexico, and 12,000 in Honduras. GrainChain estimates that it has processed more than 2.6 million tons of produce on its platform.The firm’s migration to Assembly is expected to bolster the agritech platform's speed, privacy, and facilitate scaling. Medici hopes that GrainChain will launch in several new countries before 2021 — with Johnson eying South and Central America.“GrainChain’s goal is to continue to grow into new countries to help support farmers around the globe, and Symbiont’s blockchain platform is the solution that will help us reach that goal,” said GrainChain’s chief executive and founder, Luis Macias.Macias added that the funding will be used to “continue product development and expansion to meet market demands in more countries.”Medici Seeks to Invest in Blockchain-Based Nation-Building PlatformsMedici Ventures announced that it had acquired an additional $5 million of equity in GrainChain on March 6 after leading an $8.2 million funding round. The venture firm had previously invested $2.5 million in late-2018.Medici’s GrainChain invests align with the firm’s plan to develop a blockchain-based suite of national-building products and services for emerging economies.In 2018, analytics firm Markets and Markets predicted that the global blockchain-based agricultural market will be worth nearly $430 million by 2023."
42123," Overview of Software Wallets, the Easy Way to Store Crypto ",2020-03-29t02:00:00+01:00,3677,137,"Similar to a bank account for fiat currency, a crypto wallet is a personal interface for a cryptocurrency network that provides reliable storage and enables transactions. Whether a cryptocurrency is securely stored or not, much depends on the wallet, which is only as secure as its private keys.Wallets are generally either hot or cold. The funds in a hot wallet can be spent at any time, online. A cold wallet functions in contrast: not intended for regular cryptocurrency transactions, but funds can be received at any time. Wallets can also be divided into three groups: software, hardware and paper. Today, we will take a look at the most widespread group of crypto wallets ー software.What is a software wallet?Software wallets come in many forms, each with its own set of unique characteristics. Most are somehow connected to the internet and are hot in nature. Wallets are distinguished by a set of supported cryptocurrencies and software platforms such as Windows, Mac and other operating systems. Software wallets are available in three forms — desktop, mobile and online:Desktop wallets are computer programs that store cryptocurrencies on a PC so that its information is not accessible to anyone but the user, whose private keys are kept only on the desktop.Mobile wallets come in the form of a smartphone app and are easily accessible to their users at any time, considering most people don’t leave their homes without their phones. However, it is worth remembering that mobile devices are vulnerable to various malware and can be easily lost.Online wallets are web wallets that can be accessed from anywhere and any device, making them more convenient, but the private keys are stored by website owners rather than locally on user devices.So, the burning question on everyone’s mind is: Which of these software wallets do I choose?ExodusExodus is one of the most popular software wallets for storing Bitcoin (BTC) and supports over 110 other cryptocurrencies. Launched in 2015 and based in Nebraska, the service is supported by all major software platforms.The Exodus code is partially open-source. Private keys are controlled by the users and do not leave the device where the wallet is installed. The service’s philosophy implies the absence of any personal identification and interaction with banks. Exodus has partnered up with several exchange partners to offer transfer services on a wider range of coins.Exodus is a free service, while its transaction fees are paid only to miners and determined automatically using the Bitcoin fee service. The size of a transaction in the wallet is determined by the number of inputs and outputs. The more input, the more expensive the transaction becomes. The wallet charges a portion of the commission for facilitating transactions made within the system.Electrum Bitcoin WalletThe Electrum Bitcoin Wallet is a reliable service that has been around since 2011. It is a so-called “thin” cold wallet, where the entire blockchain is not downloaded to the user’s device but is rather stored on the network servers. In this case, private keys are stored on the user’s computer in an encrypted form and are never sent to the server.Versions of the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet can be automatically synchronized on different computers. If users want to use another client program or an online service in the future, they can easily export their keys there or import keys into a cold wallet.This crypto wallet can sign transactions on a device disconnected from the network by saving a new transaction onto a USB flash drive and then loading it onto a device connected to the internet, where the new transaction can be imported onto the network. The wallet is functionally an analog of a hardware wallet, albeit with a slightly more complex chain of actions, and also uses two-level encryption.Jaxx LibertyBased in Canada, Jaxx was launched in 2016 by Anthony Di Iorio, CEO and founder of Decentral as well as a co-founder of Ethereum. Jaxx is available on most popular operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS and also as an extension in the Google Chrome web browser.Over 80 cryptocurrencies are available as the ShapeShift exchange is also integrated into the Jaxx wallet for easy and fast transactions. The Jaxx platform does not support fiat money exchange operations or multi-signature. It is a free service, and its transaction fees are paid to miners and differ by currency. When transferring BTC, users choose from three options for fees, depending on the urgency of the transfer.All of Jaxx’s code is open-source except for the user interface. Private keys are controlled by users and do not leave devices that have had wallets installed on them. To verify transactions, centralized validation technology is used. The intuitive controls render this wallet user-friendly and convenient to use.However, the company has had its rough times. In 2017, Jaxx was hacked, and more than $400,000 in various cryptocurrencies was stolen. However, Jaxx Chief Technical Officer Nilang Vyas said in a Reddit post that, unlike hardware wallets, Jaxx is not designed for long-term storage of crypto assets and that users should store only small amounts of funds in their Jaxx wallets.Atomic WalletFounded in 2017, Atomic Wallet is a desktop app that provides users with full control over their cryptocurrency savings, as the private keys and transactional data for this service are stored on users’ computers rather than on the provider’s servers.Atomic Wallet is compatible with all known operating systems and currently supports more than 300 cryptocurrencies, including the most common ones, alongside most ERC-20 tokens and its own Atomic Wallet Coin (AWC). The app can be downloaded for free, but it does contain certain paid services:Purchasing cryptocurrency with a credit card (a 2% commission and minimum commission of $10).Currency transactions within the wallet, such as peer-to-peer.Transactions conducted through ShapeShift.As a solution that lacks servers, Atomic Wallet does not require registration from its users. Therefore, the wallet does not store any confidential personal information and does not utilize the services of intermediaries to conduct transactions.All data transferred is encrypted, as users receive a unique “backup phrase” comprising 12 randomly generated words to recover access to their wallets to serve as a backup should other forms of verification fail, or in case a mobile phone is lost.Bitcoin CoreBitcoin Core was created in 2009 and is based on the wallet program code that was published along with Bitcoin’s project software, thereby ensuring streamlined functionality along the network.In 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation began developing applications based on the original Bitcoin project code. The main focus was on the wallet as a dominant app that met the primary needs of the network: storage and money transfer.Bitcoin Core was one of the first wallets to support SegWit technology and serves as a reference cold wallet for BTC. No other currencies are supported. The wallet can be downloaded as a desktop application on Windows, Linux and Mac.The main advantage of Bitcoin Core is its security. All information is stored on the user’s PC, independent of third parties and other entities’ servers. A file with private keys is generated and stored by the user — no one else can access it.With Bitcoin Core, the user can be guaranteed complete anonymity, including anonymized payments. Bitcoin Core uses an address rotation system, making it practically impossible to track the sender and the recipient addresses — provided that different addresses are used for each transaction.Among the wallet’s shortcomings is low mobility, which may be unappealing for many potential users. Bitcoin Core lacks a mobile version, and this is likely to remain the case, as mobile use contradicts the wallet’s foundational principles of operation and security. Installing a wallet on another computer or even on a reinstalled OS will also not help to recover the funds, as the entire synchronization process (i.e., data downloading and verifying validity) would need to be repeated.BitGoBitGo is a blockchain company founded in 2013 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California. While originally a BTC wallet, BitGo has added support for other popular cryptocurrencies over the years. The BitGo wallet is a web wallet that can be connected through a desktop computer, laptop or other devices. The mobile version of the wallet allows storing keys on user devices. Additionally, keys can be transferred to other devices.The company has developed two versions of its wallet for either individual or business use.In addition to being an online wallet, BitGo offers a service providing reliable storage of digital assets for institutional investors through its partnership with Kingdom Trust. In the spring of 2018, the wallet began supporting the ERC-20 standard, expanding the list of supported digital currencies to 90. However, this is of little use to ordinary investors, as all ERC-20 tokens on BitGo are available only to institutional investors.Each BitGo wallet has three keys: One is stored on BitGo, the second on the user’s device and the third through the Key Recovery Service software. To avoid third-party involvement, just two signatures are required to complete transactions. Access to the wallet is protected by two-factor authentication, and users must confirm their IP every time they log in to their wallets. BitGo charges a fee of 0.25% on all withdrawals up to 1 BTC alongside the usual mining fees.Like Jaxx Liberty, the BitGo wallet has been at the center of a scandal. In 2015, BitGo and Bitfinex announced their collaboration to create a multi-signature wallet system. The companies decided to put user funds into a mixed storage, in which some were stored on large, offline wallets and the rest online. As a result, each user had three keys, two of which were stored by Bitfinex and the third by BitGo.However, in August 2016, Bitfinex discovered that more than $60 million in BTC had been withdrawn from its users’ hot wallets. To this day, no explanation has been offered as to how the attackers managed to pull this off other than BitGo confirming on its official Twitter page that its servers had not been breached.Crypto wallets going forwardCryptocurrency wallets are an integral part of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are a fundamental element of the crypto infrastructure that allows funds to transfer across blockchain networks. Each wallet has its own advantages and disadvantages, so understanding how they work and what kind of activities they facilitate is essential before moving on to using them.In any case, software wallets are becoming increasingly popular, and according to Atomic Wallet’s PR manager, Kristina Khachatryan, they are becoming more accessible and attractive every day:“The software wallets are getting to be more and more accessible for a larger number of people, more multifunctional and filled with cool features at the same time losing nothing in the performance or the security issue. Moreover, the possibility of the decentralized staking is the central opening of this year. That’s why we see high potentials in this field of the software wallets and believe that the market will be surely driven to grow by the increased popularity of this product.”Exodus’s communications manager, Davey Zelaya, is confident that the software market will develop at a faster pace as more cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions continue to be launched:“We expect the market to continue to demand user-friendly software to interact with the increasing number of blockchain products and applications. In short, we want to make crypto easy for everyone. Right now, decentralized apps are still bulky and sometimes difficult to navigate. We want to change that.”"
42121, Will China Launch its Blockchain Service Network Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic? ,2020-03-28t23:30:00+00:00,6603,145,"Numerous cryptocurrency media outlets have published recent reports asserting that China’s Blockchain Service Network will launch in April 2020.However, these predictions appear to be based on local reports published prior to China’s first official fatality resulting from COVID-19.China’s Blockchain Service Network commences testing in October 2019On October 15, 2019, Chinese state-operated media outlet, Xinhua news, reported that the country’s Blockchain Service Network, or BSN, had commenced testing. The project’s six-month internal testing phase was initially scheduled to finish at the end of March 2020.The development of the network’s core technologies was then nearing completion, and more than 50 public nodes had been deployed in 31 provinces and municipalities across the country.In early January, just as COVID-19 was first being identified as a unique virus and not a recurrence of SARS, Tang Sisi, the deputy head of the Smart City Development Research Center of SIC, announced that the BSN would launch during April after the trial had completed.Roughly one week later, China announced its first official COVID-19 fatality.Coronavirus pandemic may disrupt the launch of China’s BSNWhile the platform had reportedly processed nearly $12.7 billion in transactions for 44 banks and almost 1,900 companies throughout trials in Shenzhen alone by mid-January, news regarding the BSN appears to have dried up as the coronavirus pandemic began to take shape in China.The most recent official mention of the project appears to be a March 9 report published by Chinese state-owned media outlet, Global Times. While the article announces that the People’s Bank of China had secured $4.7 million in research funding for the BSN over three years, the report contains no mention of an upcoming launch for the BSN.China deploys blockchain to fight COVID-19Despite the spread of coronavirus beginning to slow in China, the recent near-total devotion of the Chinese state apparatus to fighting COVID-19 may mean that an April launch for BSN is unlikely.However, the pandemic has proved a good testing ground for many of blockchain’s applications — with China deploying distributed ledger technologies to track and record medical supplies, charity donations, and the spread of the virus.The BSN was first revealed in Shenzhen during September 2018, with the network intended to bolster China’s digital economy and underpin the construction of ‘smart cities.’The blockchain network has been developed through collaboration between the state-run telecom provider, China Mobile, the government-support payment processor, China UnionPay, the State Information Center (SIC), and several other state institutions."
42120, Do Video Games Subconsciously Teach Users Crypto Economics? ,2020-03-28t22:00:00+00:00,3334,124,"The underlying premise of many video games might actually give people a core understanding of economics, especially in the crypto space.“As a kid, I played a lot of RuneScape,” crypto YouTuber and programmer Ivan on Tech said in a March 28 video.RuneScape is a medieval era fantasy game in which players interact with other live players, completing journeys, buying, selling, and trading various tools and materials, as well as battling.“A part of RuneScape is that it has its own economy,” Ivan said. “There’s actually a lot of experience you get from playing games as a kid,” he also noted. “I learned my first market mechanics in this game.”RuneScape helped Ivan on Tech learn to flip crypto assetsLooking over a list of various fake, digital items within RuneScape, Ivan showed that players can sell and trade thousands of items, such as gold, water, steel, grapes and a plethora of other supplies.Clicking on each item brings up a stock-like chart showing the asset’s price journey over time within the game. Some of said items even showed volatility reminiscent of cryptocurrencies.“Oak logs, they had a bull market up until December of 2019, and, since then, they entered a bear market in RuneScape,” Ivan explained.Ivan found out about pump and dumps from the gameThe YouTuber said RuneScape even taught him about pump-and-dumps — a less than moral method of pumping an asset’s price through deception, only to dump on hopeful buyers later, crashing prices in the process.Ivan explained that RuneScape helped him see which assets were going through pump-and-dumps in crypto. “I got my first experience being dumped upon in RuneScape,” he said.This recognition can help investors and traders stay away from, or navigate, potentially risky trades.Other games also teach similar market familiarityRuneScape is not the only game housing a framework similar to real-world economics. A virtual world game called Second Life employs Linden Dollars — simulated online money players can buy with USD.World of Warcraft also holds an internal economy similar to that of RuneScape. Some players even try to sell items for real world cash.Additionally, ties between video games and real life economics have only increased with time. Cryptocurrency and blockchain pave the way for sending in-game currency into the real world for sale and trade, as well as ability to transfer items between users.On a similar note, blockchain-based virtual reality platforms are on the rise, selling digital real estate for crypto assets such at Ethereum (ETH)."
42119," Network of Fake Bitcoin QR Code Generators Stole $45,000 in March ",2020-03-29t06:30:00+01:00,8322,138,"A network of malicious QR code generators has stolen more than $40,000 from Bitcoin (BTC) users in one month.At least nine fake Bitcoin-to-QR code generators have been spotted in recent weeks, with security researcher, Harry Denley, first tweeting that he had identified two domains hosting fake QR code applications on March 22.Denley later identified seven other domains sharing the same interface — suggesting that they are all created by the same developer.Fake Bitcoin QR code generators steal over 7 BTCThe malicious programs promise to convert a user’s Bitcoin address into a QR code, claiming to eliminate the risk of the user losing their funds as a result of typos when entering or sharing their address — a service offered by every popular block explorer and most mobile wallet applications.However, the QR code generated by the programs is always the same address — diverting the victims’ funds to the malicious program’s developers. The supposed QR generators correspond to five different wallets, which have absorbed more than seven BTC, likely from the apps’ victims.The malicious websites are bitcoin-barcode-generator.com, bitcoinaddresstoqrcode.com, bitcoins-qr-code.com, btc-to-qr.com, create-bitcoin-qr-code.com, free-bitcoin-qr-codes.com, freebitcoinqrcodes.com, qr-code-bitcoin.com, and qrcodebtc.com.‘Bitcoin transaction accelerators’ accumulate 17.6 BTCThe websites are hosted by three different servers that collectively host roughly 450 other websites that appear sketchy — with the sites featuring keywords related to coronavirus, Gmail, and various cryptocurrencies.Among the sites are several purported “Bitcoin transaction accelerators,” which claim to speed up BTC transfers in exchange for a 0.001 BTC. The BTC addresses associated with the supposed ‘accelerators’ have absorbed more than 17.6 BTC — taking in nearly $110,000.Crypto scams capitalize on coronavirus fearsOpportunistic scammers have sought to capitalize on the COVID-19 pandemic — with UK county regulators, the Texas State Securities Board, and the US Commodity Futures Trade Commission issuing warnings about the proliferation of coronavirus crypto scams over the past week.Recent scams have also impersonated the World Health Organization in an attempt to siphon donations, and taken the form of apps purporting to track the spread of coronavirus."

It’s up around 23 percent over the last week, even as the Bitcoin clock continues its countdown. We’re now entering the last 50 days of a 12.5 BTC reward.These are strange times for everyone but despite Bitcoin’s volatility, the digital coin seems to have held up. Marcel Pechman argues that Bitcoin was designed for a financial crisis and says that in the current pandemic, it’s working well.Cryptocurrencies could work even better though if politicians would get their act together. The economic stimulus bill originally contained a requirement to create a digital dollar, but a 1,400-page update removed it. Rep. Maxine Waters and Sen. Sherrod Brown later submitted separate bills to reinstate the requirement. That’s almost as much whiplash as a week of crypto trading. The courts aren’t helping much, either. A United States District Court has ruled that Telegram can’t release its GRAM tokens. They’re unregistered securities, the court says.Senator Kelly Loeffler, the former CEO of Bakkt, says that she had nothing to do with her portfolio’s sale of shares (and purchase of shares in teleconferencing companies) just before the market tanked. MakerDAO says that the Maker Foundation did not place winning bids in its recent debt auctions. That auction didn’t exactly take off. And in Texas, the State Securities Board is warning of the spread of pump-and-dump scams, hoping to cash in on the fear of COVID-19. Keep an eye out for those.

42115, Malta Denies Two Crypto Exchanges Have License to Operate ,2020-03-28t19:30:00+00:00,4897,106,"The Malta Financial Services Authority, or MFSA, has issued an alert on March 25 about two crypto exchanges that do not have licenses to operate, nor are they regulated in the country.COINMALEX and Crypto Foxtrades are the exchanges that the country’s financial watchdog alluded to in the statement, as both companies claimed on their websites that they had the necessary regulations and licenses to operate.Crypto Foxtrades claimed that they had the “Category 3 Investment Services” provider from the Maltese authorities to operate.The MFSA clarified the following about Crypto Foxtrades in the public warning:“The MFSA wishes to alert the public, in Malta and abroad, that Crypto Foxtrades is NOT a Maltese registered Company NOR licenced or otherwise authorised by the MFSA to provide the service of an exchange or other financial services which are required to be licenced or otherwise authorised under Maltese law.”Scheme of “dubious nature”As for COINMALEX, the financial watchdog adds that the information they have about this crypto exchange suggests that it is a scheme of “dubious nature” and that it could carry a high risk of losing money.On their official website, COINMALEX claims to offer trust assets management of the highest quality through cryptocurrency trading.The MFSA advises the following:“The public should therefore refrain from undertaking any business or transactions with the above-mentioned entity.”Recent warnings issued by the MFSAThe public warning comes after Malta’s financial watchdog said on February 21 that the major cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has never been licensed to operate in the country.The following day, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on the MFSA’s statement via Twitter, which he described as “old news” and stated that Binance “has a number of regulated entities around the world, either operated by our partners or by Binance.com directly.”However, speaking to Cointelegraph, Malta’s Junior Minister for Financial Services and Digital Economy, BartoloClayton, clarified the position that the watchdog has regarding crypto in the country despite the public warning on Binance:“This therefore DOES NOT mean that the Government has in some way or another introduced a harsher or more stringent stance towards cryptos, but merely an authority stating facts. On the contrary, the Government of Malta is committed to consolidate blockchain together with other niche sectors.”"

Luis Gelado, GeoDB CEO and founder shared with Cointelegraph his rationale for creating AidSquad:“Having stayed home for a few weeks, one weekend, I felt a little bored, so I started thinking: we have to do something. We have a chance to develop something for a concrete problem, give back to society”.Source: GeoDBA user inputs his Personal Health Record (PHR) — age, gender, symptoms associated with the COVID-19, and the app also collects the user's approximate location. The data are anonymously stored in Iota tangle. Based on this data, heatmaps can be generated that visualize the spread of the virus and contagion hotspots.Source: GeoDBThe app is currently only available as an Android Package Kit (apk). According to Gelado, both Apple Store and Google Play temporarily barred all new COVID-19 apps because too many unscrupulous developers were taking advantage of the situation. However, he expects the app to be accepted to both stores in a couple of weeks.Source: GeoDBThe app rewards users for sharing data with “karma points” and Aid Squad tokens. Karma points are a gamification device similar to the one employed by Duolingo, whereas, AidSquad tokens are donated to the user’s favorite charitable cause.Government is not doing its jobGelado states that Madrileños are upset with the government’s inability to combat the spread of the virus effectively and it’s up to the people to feel the void:“People are angry with politicians. We have the right to know. They don't provide enough information. We wanted to build a network that would exchange information in a public way while protecting privacy. The government of Madrid created some tools, but you have to share so much personal information.”The beauty of the decentralized world is that an idea born in Madrid could benefit people anywhere in the world including the U.S. which on March 26 has become the world leader in confirmed coronavirus cases."
42106, Talking Digital Future: Artificial Intelligence ,2020-03-28t16:10:00+00:00,2260,180,"I chose artificial intelligence as my next topic, as it can be considered as one of the most known technologies, and people imagine it when they talk about the future. But the right question would be: What is artificial intelligence?Artificial intelligence is not something that just happened in 2015 and 2016. It’s been around for a hundred years as an idea, but as a science, we started seeing developments from the 1950s. So, this is quite an old tech topic already, but because of the kinds of technology that we have access to today — specifically, processing performance and storage — we’re starting to see significant leaps in AI development.When I started the course entitled, “Foundations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0),” I got deeper into the topic of artificial intelligence. One of the differences between the third industrial revolution — defined by the microchip and digitization — and the fourth industrial revolution is the scope, velocity and breakthroughs in medicine and biology, as well as widespread use of artificial intelligence across our society. Thus, AI is not only a product of Industry 4.0 but also an impetus as to why the fourth industrial revolution is currently happening and will continue to do so. I think there are two ways to understand AI: the first way is to try giving a quick definition of what it is, but the second is to also think about what it is not.Artificial intelligence as an imitation of humansThe definition that I’ve found useful in my own research is that AI is machines imitating humans. I believe this definition is important, because when many of us think about AI, we think of it as either being human or being better than human. I also think that’s not where we’re at today.There are different types of intelligence. One is artificial general intelligence, or superintelligence. The key here is in the word artificial, meaning an imitation. And it tries to replicate what humans do very well, but it can do it at an even better speed and at scale.So, if a human is given a 100-page book containing 100 photographs and is asked to circle every bicycle shown within, of course, the human will be able to do it and will do really well. Humans will probably do it with great accuracy, but they won’t be terribly quick at it. We’ll take the first picture, we’ll look at it, we’ll circle the bicycle, we’ll move onto the next picture, and so on until the 100th photograph. Humans barely have to think about it. It’s such a natural thing for us. But if you give this task to a computer today, it will do it in seconds, as it can imitate that human work remarkably faster. The speed really cannot be understated here. If you can combine the speed of processing with scale, you can start to augment what humans do, and find clever ways to do human processes, which many people have already been exposed to in the last few years. One of these is online recommendations. In Amazon’s early days, when you bought a book, you would be recommended some other books that you might like based on your preferences: People who bought this book also liked these books, so you might like them as well. This was a very clever usage of AI technology: Being able to look for patterns and make conclusions based on the conditions that humans set, and then serve them very quickly.Suddenly, this technological application became remarkably beneficial. Another example is getting from point A to point B. Today, this is a product, again, of fast processing and storage — thus, artificial intelligence. If you’re sitting in traffic while using a GPS device on your smartphone, and there’s a better way to get home to avoid traffic, that technology is going to evaluate many different permutations. You could do it as a human, but you can’t do it as fast and you certainly wouldn’t be able to consider all the tradeoffs between various routes. Whereas computers are very good at processing at this volume and scale.Some useful applications for artificial intelligenceSo, as a domain, artificial intelligence is going to continue to show up in many aspects of our lives. The fact that we’re all getting connected now means that you don’t have to have scale processing on your device, as you are connected to a query that is initiated through some activity being shot to the cloud. Like this, you have massive amounts of processing. In fact, we think that ultimately, quantum computing could manifest through cloud services. It’s very unlikely that we’re going to have a quantum chip or quantum computer on a smartphone. I don’t say never, but I just don’t think it will happen. What we’ll have is cloud-based quantum processing for artificial intelligence.This topic is especially cool in the healthcare domain. Think about how medicine works today. Medical practitioners go to school for many, many years, memorize a lot of information, then treat patients, get experience, and over the span of their career, become quite good at what they do. However, they are ultimately subject to the weaknesses of their own mortal existence. They can forget things; they can be absent-minded or, you know, just not connect the dots sometimes. Now, if we can equip a doctor physician with a computer to improve memory, options and optimization, the tools and the ability to provide medical aid suddenly change.Let’s look at IBM’s AI initiative Watson combined with an oncologist treating a cancer patient, for example. Each patient is different, so the doctor wants to have as many details as possible about this type of cancer and the patient’s medical history to make the best treatment plan. An AI-augmented device produced for the doctor’s team could generate a scenario based on the data of every patient that has had this particular set of circumstances and that person’s characteristics. The patient could be a white male, 75 years old, living in a certain country and is of a certain genetic background. Suddenly, augmentation at an AI-level of scale and speed is changing the game.So, my view is that we’re going to head into a world where there’s a lot more of that. Primary philosophical concerns for AI that will become very important in the future are, Can we ultimately displace the human so that these activities are just done by computers? Is there a role forward for humans in this AI future? The truth is, we’re finding that humans don’t really have value in a whole range of industries. So, how big and how massive would this displacement be?Artificial intelligence for multiplanetary colonizationThink of Elon Musk’s dream to create a colony on Mars. The problem is that people going there now would have a six-month journey, they would have to take all their possessions, food, seeds, medicine and so on, and after that, they would have to start healing Mars and creating a livable environment. Maybe this could serve as a great opportunity to realize that sending artificial intelligence first would be better and more quickly prepare new colonies for human beings. I think we’ll probably send robots first. Although, there is talk right now that sending humans is helpful for getting government funding, as it turns out to be a human achievement. It’s all about that.When we were doing the Apollo missions to send humans to the moon in the 1960s, at first, we sent robots and rockets and we landed them. But in 1969, when we landed a human, when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, it changed everything. It was a completely different experience.Of course, we will attempt a multiplanetary existence if we want to extend the survival of humanity. For going beyond the Alpha Centauri and other solar systems, though, we might just send AI. Even at amazing speed, traveling these distances takes a long time — thousands of years. Eventually, one of these crafts might be fortunate enough to be intercepted by other intelligent life whose first exposure to humans on Earth will be robots and computers. They won’t actually meet a person, a biological being like you and I.So, this potential human future might actually be computers floating in the universe. It’s a more practical way for us to extend this idea. Otherwise, we would have to have multiple generations of humans born, raised and living on a spaceship.Challenges for the development of artificial intelligenceThe other possible course for AI development, which Elon Musk has also spoken about, is that maybe we have to separate human consciousness from the physical body. So your consciousness is basically uploaded to a computer and you can theoretically live forever, in a computer traveling through space. It boggles the mind. Really, it’s mind-expanding, because we don’t think in those terms at all. This is not how we think of the human experience — or existence at all — as we still have very old beliefs and religions about what it is to be human, what life is, the soul, and so on in our societies. Technology now is disrupting not only these beliefs, but also all our stereotypes, our understandings and our thoughts, which we as a species have had a long history with.Anyway, let’s continue to see how AI is embedded in everything we do. If you have a technological device, it’s probably going to have some form of AI, which will be powered by cloud services that continue to evolve and continue to groove. So, anything we do as humans that requires access to large amounts of data, expert systems, expert device optimization, etc., are invariably going to be AI.Going back to an earlier point, the example of an AI’s performance on a human process outpacing that of a human may allude to artificial intelligence being intelligent or smart, but that assumption would not be correct today. AIs really don’t have any “smartness,” they are simply performing artificial mimicry — a parlor trick that makes them look smart. It simply has access to a lot of data, or big data, and uses some mathematics.There is a type of learning called trial-and-error learning, in which one “successively tries various responses in a situation, seemingly at random, until one is successful in achieving the goal.” There was once a game on Google where users could spend time identifying pictures. A picture would show up on-screen, users playing against each other would be given four options as to what the picture depicted, and then the users would select the word closest to the picture. The whole idea was basically training the computer to associate difficult photos with English language terms. What machine learning effectively does as a subset of AI is using historical improvements in its database to make better suggestions and predictions going forward.This idea of predicting what happens is a sort of snowball: You can build new knowledge upon what you have already learned, which was also initially built upon what you had already learned. To add to this, the ability to predict gets much more precise over time, increasing our confidence and ambition with AI.Artificial intelligence: Use casesToday, apart from the takeoff and landing, a computer controls just about the entire flight of a commercial plane. We have a lot of confidence (or at least, the pilots do) that the plane can react to different circumstances and even know when to hand certain circumstances over to the pilots to contemplate. I say this with a little bit of ignorance, as a computer controlling takeoff and landing may already be in use. Today’s computers have enough processing power and information to make all the decisions necessary for flying a plane entirely.So, I think about the positive sides of where we are. There’s a whole set of things that can just get better. I think a lot about healthcare, and I believe AI is something that will enhance our ability to make big leaps, big innovations and major breakthroughs in healthcare, which has plateaued for many decades and is long-due for a transformation.We will certainly see improvements in production. We’ve got this notion of digital twins now: Making an artificial digital version or a copy of the real physical thing while putting sensors on the physical object. Let’s say again: A factory machine that produces a product and the digital version will entirely replicate what’s going on in the physical world. With the help of sensors and artificial intelligence, the machine can do things like predictive maintenance and even calibrate in real time. With this, we’ll be starting to get much more sophisticated, higher-quality tools of production.I think we’ll see better use of energy, things like energy distribution and optimization, where AI applications could dramatically change the industry for good.Another topic that I think is very important to humanity is our understanding of the weather and climate, which has a couple of major challenges on some remarkably complex topics that we’re still trying to figure out, particularly the climate. The computers that we have, which are based on classical computing systems, are not quite fast enough to even use the algorithms they’re provided to make predictions on what will happen. So, we’re going to need even faster processing. This is where, in my view, things get interesting — when we combine AI with quantum computing. The convergence of clever algorithms imitating humans driven by remarkable processing power can potentially start to solve some climate scenarios that are currently taking weeks and months to process on classical computers.There’s a whole lot of other interesting areas that are emerging. One of the areas that has remarkable potential but is yet to be realized is augmented virtual or mixed realities. These provide us with a kind of heads-up display for a whole range of things in work, life and in general, as well as the spheres of gaming and global collaboration. Again, AI is going to help with better rendering and better simulation. That isn’t just a fleeting topic, by the way, it means an AI plus hardware, faster processing, cloud functionality, connectivity, even visualization tools and the screens all need improvements.Artificial intelligence and other technologiesI think that brings me to my final point on this, which is: We shouldn’t think of AI alone. I think this is a mistake that many researchers and commentators often make when talking about the amazing benefits of AI, when we’re rather talking about software here. Combining AI with other technologies and industries is no less amazing.So, I’d rather think about AI plus quantum, plus big data, plus blockchain, plus the supply chain, plus pharmaceuticals, plus healthcare. These are interesting prospects to think about, so convergence to me is really where the power of AI lies.Think about the convergence of AI with blockchain, and how those technologies can be used together for the development of security, immutability, transparency and decentralization. I think of AI as an amplifier and blockchain as a powerful tool, and there is no doubt that the former will be involved in the set of technologies producing leading-edge solutions. No matter what, if blockchain is doing identity management or supply chain, or it is a very smart repository management system, AI baked into that architecture could make it better, faster and more precise. I can definitely see the intersections there.One of the intersections of AI is with the Internet of Things. Let’s imagine a sensor that is part of the IoT: A complex, local sensor in a busy intersection that probably has a camera and perhaps another kind of environmental sensor embedded. Everything captured on the sensor in this IoT network is immediately sent to the cloud and processed, and maybe some action is sent back.The latency issues involved, though, don’t make this massively practical today. You can either have a sensor that does something simple, or you bring the computer-processing to the sensor itself, developing what’s called edge computing. A certain level of AI takes place on the device so that only the really meaningful data is sent back over the cloud to be processed, and then some action is taken.Not restricted to intersections, AI in the area of IoT sensors could be implemented in aircrafts, warehouses and cities, enabling very fast computation, filtering and decision-making at the edge. This creates a much faster and more efficient overall ecosystem.Artificial intelligence and moneyAnother good question is, Does artificial intelligence need money? Let’s imagine a colony on Mars occupied by artificial intelligence alone. Would robots think that they still need to be paid? I think money is a very human thing. It has a very special role in the behavior of humans as well as strong relationships with reward, incentives and scarcity. These are all very human things.What is needed for robots and AI is energy. We have to make the assumption that we’re talking about artificial intelligence here, and AI will work forever — as long as power is going to it. It doesn’t care for anything beyond that. It lacks an emotional component.This may change when we get to artificial superintelligence or artificial general intelligence, where we may see and call AI a type of consciousness, but let’s stick with AI, which is what we know today. To put it simply, the notion of bartering and incentives doesn’t seem to play a role; I would say what is most important is an energy source.If an AI has an amazing solar power grid on the moon with really efficient batteries, it’s going to work for hundreds of years — assuming it can be maintained without such issues.However, there is a twist to this. Imagine for a moment that we’re already at the point of everyone riding in self-driving cars and every car is equal on the road. No vehicle gets priority over another in terms of lanes or intersections. Basically, the main priority is safety, so when self-driving vehicles come to an intersection where they’re going to collide, they have an interaction between each other to avoid the collision, but there’s no prioritization other than rules of the road.Now imagine you get into one of these, and it’s an Uber of the future. The Uber has two fees: $10 for the trip and an optional $15. The difference is, if you pay that $15, your ride will get preference over lower-paying passengers. So let’s say you’ve paid an additional $15 and you get to this intersection — all other cars slow down. What happens is your car pays a premium to the other cars to slow down, giving yours the preferential route. So, these artificially intelligent cars — or, I’ve heard somebody call them “mobots” (mobile robots) — are going to start trading with each other, as they’re all going to have different pricing and a lot of different preferences. As they interact and have machine-to-machine communications, they will be sending cash or cryptocurrency.It’s likely that, between the devices, preferential or less preferential treatment can be given or leased. Although it’s a little bit of a stretch in terms of the example above, robots paying for other robots to behave in certain ways based on different outcomes could become a reality. Ultimately, the question of risk in this example begins with: Where does the money go? Money trickles down to humans. Eventually, there will be shareholders or some organization incentivized to profit from this behavior.Humans are basically the only creatures who create things symbolic of value, which then define our interactions.Artificial intelligence and modern societyMy next idea enters the paradigm of the post-truth society we live in. I worry a lot about the era we’re in right now. I like to think that in a few years, we’ll look back at this time and agree that it was a dark period.Things started to get dark quickly in the years leading up to World War II in Europe. It didn’t even take decades. In the time that Adolf Hitler became known, moved through the ranks and became the chancellor, only three years passed. World War II raged for just six years, but in that brief window of time, Europe was destroyed almost beyond recognition and several millions of people were killed. Yet somehow out of that, we had the 1950s and the 1960s — periods of great optimism and change, liberalism and democracy, with a general positive hope for the future. At the time, anyone might have said that 1941 was the end or that there was no future for humanity, and yet here we are in the 21st century with a remarkably different world.These periods of darkness in the last few hundred years are just periods of massive uncertainty and instability. Yet, things have to get sorted out. The world wars happened because of empires, and then the empires collapsed and were rejigged. Finally, countries started to set borders in the 1950s and 1960s, and things like the United Nations and European Union began to emerge.Right now, the uncertainty is because suddenly, billions of people who never had a voice suddenly have one. Billions of people are connected and millions of them are moving to the middle class. Everybody wants a smartphone, a laptop, a car and a television, and more people want to meet. We are going through an incredible societal change while a dark cloud of climate change looms on the horizon.If you look at the data, though — education, rights for women, rights for minorities, the rate of diseases, wars — everything is much better. We pay attention to the darkness, but we forget the bigger picture is actually quite positive.I do think there are some very unstable, unpredictable things happening right now, a lot of which is generated by our massive use of networks and collaboration of technologies. This is one of the manifestations of our post-truth world, and I think my comments here might be more personal than generalized.I think honesty and truth are essential not only to what it means to be human, but to creating stability in the world. So I am very concerned as both a citizen and as a human being that people who have power are not telling the truth, which encourages corporations and other entities to create untruths.One specific example of this is deepfakes — videos powered by artificial intelligence, processing and visual technology showing people saying or doing things they never said or did. Soon, we won’t be able to differentiate between what is fake and what is reality. I think we’ll even see a movie in a few years that features actors that are no longer alive, perhaps with Marlon Brando and Marilyn Monroe — and they will seem completely and utterly real, we won’t not be able to tell with our eyes that it’s all fake.Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that can improve our lives greatly, and it is already doing this. At the same time, AI could have a nefarious impact on our society. How we will use this powerful technology is only up to us, humans.This is part two of a multi-part series on digital future and technological innovations, read part one about quantum computing here.This article is from an interview held by Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr with Dr. Jonathan Reichental.

Unlike the Lightning sidechain which is designed to quickly clear a large volume of smaller transactions, Liquid caters to larger transactions and can hide the sums involved in a transfer.Many major crypto firms are currently members of liquid, including exchanges Bitfinex BitMEX, Huobi, Unocoin, and SIX Digital Exchanges.New federation members to launch Liquid-based products and servicesAfter joining Liquid, ListedReserve now plans to launch an Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin on the network.Ledger plans to support Liquid assets on its hardware wallets and in its Ledger Vault. Hodl Hodl will be supporting L-BTC as a payment option on its Bitcoin (BTC) marketplace.The Liquid network now exhibits great liquidity than the Lightning network — with 952 BTC held on Liquid as opposed to Lighting’s 899 BTC. $16 million in Tether (USDT) is also circulating on Liquid.BTSE launches first exchange token on LiquidAt the start of March, Liquid member and crypto exchange, BTSE, launched what it claimed to be the first native exchange token on the Liquid Network.The BTSE initial exchange offering (IEO) sold out in four hours, distributing 1 million BTSE tokens for $2 each."
42103, Venezuela’s Struggling Internet Could Make Crypto Trading Tough ,2020-03-28t15:07:00+00:00,2521,92,"The global coronavirus lockdown has put a strain on Venezuela’s internet, which could logically make crypto participation difficult.As much of the world hunkers down in quarantine, people logically turn to internet-based services for work, as well as a way to pass the time. This mass movement has put significant stress on available data usage capacities in Venezuela, Movistar told Bloomberg for its March 27 article.A daughter company of Telefonica SA, Movistar is the nation’s main telecom provider.Global precautions cause global strainIn an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, much of the globe presently sits quarantined in a single location.Within the first seven days of a shelter-in-place movement, Venezuelans have pushed the country’s less-than stellar internet capacities to the limit.“All this in a network that was already operating at maximum capacity,” Movistar Venezuela’s president, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zarco, explained on March 20, via a note to customers, as reported by Bloomberg. The president noted the provider’s vital role in the food and health sectors.Internet strain could mean crypto difficultiesJavier Valero, a Caracas-based attorney, has faced significant difficulties during his recent home-based work. “My Internet cuts off all the time — I’m either late or I hear half of what’s being talked about” in conference calls,” Valero told Bloomberg. “It’s so slow it’s tragic.”As the crypto space is largely an internet-based industry, digital asset trading and usage might logically become difficult for Venezuelans.After 10,000,000% inflation, citizens flocked toward crypto. July 2019 showed record Bitcoin volume numbers coming from the country. The current internet strain could possibly now make such usage more difficult.Venezuela also hit the news earlier this week as a number of the nation’s brass faced a slew of criminal charges, including narco-terrorism."
42101, Former NASDAQ Lawyer Warns TON Against Going Rogue ,2020-03-28t14:07:00+00:00,2964,82,"Former NASDAQ vice president and assistant general counsel warned the TON Community against launching Telegram’s blockchain network until the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has its say.Safe Harbor is not on SEC’s agendaManny Alicandro, a New York City lawyer with vast experience in traditional finance as well as in cases involving crypto assets, shared his concerns about the drastic plan put forward by the TON Community with Cointelegraph. He noted that in the foreseeable future, all issuers have to respect the Howey test. This may only change:“... if the Three-year Safe Harbor proposal by Commissioner Peirce is ultimately approved. With that being said, Commissioner Peirce's term expires in June 2020 and the proposed Safe Harbor is not on the SEC's rulemaking agenda. In the instance that it is added and put out for public comment, this process can take years to seek final approval.”No time for rash actionsAlicandro was referencing the announcement made by the TON Community that they may launch the fork of Telegram’s open-source TON blockchain, despite the unfavorable decision of the court in its battle against the SEC. According to the Community’s spokesperson:“The community was ready for this (or another) scenario. We have several options, including the launch of TON by TCF [TON Community Foundation]. I will say more, no one (no one) can prevent the launch of TON”.Also, Alicandro supposes that now is not the time for rash actions:“Telegram has already filed a notice of appeal to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. I wouldn’t recommend that they do anything until the 2nd Circuit appeal is decided. There is no need for urgency, especially since the world is in lockdown because of COVID-19”.On the other hand, Alicandro believes there is no way for the U.S. government to prevent the launch of the decentralized open-source network since neither TON Labs nor the TON Community are based in the U.S.Tezos sets precedent for Telegram?As Cointelegraph reported on March 26, Telegram is seeking clarity from the SEC as to whether the injunction prohibiting the distribution of Gram tokens applies to all investors in its Initial Coin Offering or just U.S. residents. Alicandro believes that it applies to all, citing the Tezos case as precedent:“The Court in Tezos performed an analysis of extraterritorially whereby Tezos had enough contact with the U.S. - server locations, marketing efforts made from the U.S. that the Court determined that it had jurisdiction over Tezos”.With none of the stakeholders seemingly willing to compromise, this battle may get nasty."
42100," Bitcoin Price Rejects $6.9K, But Is a Correction Now Imminent? ",2020-03-28t13:50:00+00:00,14787,102,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has shown a strong surge in the past weeks, as the price rallied from $3,750 to $6,900. However, the crucial $6,900 level wasn’t broken to the upside and confirmed as resistance. A similar move occurred on the equity markets, as the United States’ equity markets surged 25% in one week, but saw a sharp selloff of 4% in the last trading hour, going into the weekend.These movements lead to the general question: is there more blood to come for Bitcoin and crypto?Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360Bitcoin price can’t break $6,900The daily chart is showing a clear rejection at the $6,900 level, which is generally not a bullish perspective to look for. For bullish momentum, this area at $6,900 needed to be cleared, through which targets of $7,800 and $9,200 were back on the table.BTC USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, the breakout didn’t occur, and therefore the price is now seeking support levels. Main areas to watch for are the $5,600-5,800, $4,750-4,900 and $4,250-4,400. All these zones are substantially higher timeframe support levels and should be used for potential long opportunities.On the upside, the resistances are easily found through levels too. These levels are $6,350-6,400, $6,550-6,575 and $6,850-7,000. Breaking through the last resistance at $6,850 would certainly reintroduce bullish momentum.Weekly timeframe rejects at 100-Week Moving AverageBTC USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly timeframe is indicating a clear picture. The resistance is the 100-Week MA at $6,900, the support levels are found at the 200-Week MA ($5,500-5,700) and 300-Week MA ($3,900-4,000).Given that the price harshly rejected from the 100-Week MA, further downside is likely to be expected from the markets.But what does this chart tell us more? Well, markets in general mature and take longer to reach their new peak after the previous cycle. This statement means that the current cycle will take longer than the last cycle.The Bitcoin markets have seen several cycles, through which 2012-2014 was the first cycle, which saw the market rest on the 100-Week MA. The second cycle from 2014 to 2018 took four years and found support at the 200-Week MA.BLX Index 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewGiven that the price of Bitcoin is showing a bearish outlook — while still having a positive correlation to the equity markets — further downwards momentum is unsurprisingly expected.Alongside with that information, there’s also a conclusion to be drawn from the previous cycle. Every cycle takes longer than the previous one, due to the maturity of the markets.Combining these arguments results in the conclusion that the current cycle usually will take longer than the previous one. In other words, a bottom formation in the $3,800-4,000 area for several months wouldn’t be a surprise to investors, after which the bull market begins in 2021 and lasts through 2025-2026.A breakdown of the 200-Week MA at $5,575-5,800 is necessary for a test of the 300-Week MA. If such a breakdown occurs in the coming weeks, then we can see a significant drop towards $3,800-4,000 as the next target as momentum builds.Relief bounce on equity marketsDow Jones Index. Source: TradingViewEquity markets have seen similar moves as in the cryptomarkets, and have seen one of the most significant surges in a period of a week. The Dow Jones index surged 25% in one week despite a new record of jobless claims and a skyrocketing number of confirmed coronavirus cases.As discussed in the previous article, bubbles pop usually provide a 38-50% retrace in the first drop. The Dow Jones index dropped 40%, hit a robust yearly level at 18,000 points, and bounced upwards with 25%.Crucial levels to be watched are the 21,750-22,000 and 23,000 points areas. The moment that these levels are rejected, further downwards momentum is likely to occur. Given that the equity markets have seen a positive correlation with other markets recently, further downwards momentum can, therefore, be expected from the cryptomarkets as well.The bullish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD 2-hour chart bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario is straightforward but less likely to occur given that the price just lost a significant support level and trend.However, the moment that the price of Bitcoin can break through $6,600 and reclaim that level as support, further upwards momentum is warranted. The reasoning is that the previous support level can be confirmed as support again, turning the recent drop into a fake-out.If such a reclaim occurs to the market, it’s expected to see continuation towards $7,500 or $7,800.The bearish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD 2-hour chart bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewUnfortunately, the bearish scenario is more likely to occur at this moment. Price rejected at the $6,900 barrier, consolidated at that level for several days and broke down. The price of Bitcoin also lost an uptrend, which all indicates that there’s more downwards momentum to come.However, in the short-term, there’s a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will retest some upper levels for confirmation of resistance. The levels to be watched are the $6,375-6,400 level (monthly level) and the $6,550-6,600 level (which is the previous support).If the price of Bitcoin rejects at either of the two levels, further downwards momentum is warranted with the next potential pivot points being $5,600 and $5,750-5,800.As discussed previously, it’s likely to expect further downside on all markets given the economic instabilities around the globe. It’s crucial to remain solvent and patient in these markets. Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42099, Bitcoin Wallets Holding at Least 1 BTC Set to Hit 800K All-Time Highs ,2020-03-28t13:30:00+00:00,15896,231,"Bitcoin (BTC) addresses holding 1 BTC are on the rise — but only a maximum of 800,000 people currently own a whole coin.That is according to data released on March 28, which put the total number of wallets containing at least 1 BTC at all-time highs.Are “Wholecoiners” multiplying?The figures from monitoring resource Glassnode claim that 797,420 wallets now have a balance equal to or more than a whole Bitcoin. The number has increased by 101 wallets in the past 24 hours.Individuals may have access to more than one wallet, meaning it is unlikely that even the equivalent number of people own 1 BTC — the number of wallet owners could differ considerably. At the same time, those owners may have access to wallets with slightly lower balances.Bitcoin wallet addresses with 1 BTC balance or higher.

One theory endorsed by Cointelegraph Markets’ Keith Wareing suggests that miners who weathered Bitcoin’s drop to $3,700 this month will accumulate now in order to offset the drop in income when mining rewards halve to 6.25 BTC per block in May.Price action underscores low selling interestMeanwhile, other statistics show that traders have been moving funds off exchanges — a sign that holding, not selling BTC, is their preferred activity under current conditions.According to Glassnode, exchange balances are at their lowest since December, when BTC/USD traded at around $7,300.Bitcoin exchange balance chart.

42098, No Tax for You: Why Crypto Traders and Miners Might Head to Portugal ,2020-03-28t12:41:00+00:00,7698,400,"Existing outside of the realm of traditional finance and with no central point of authority, digital assets have posed several challenges to governments worldwide. Many nations have struggled with how to define and regulate cryptocurrencies, and there is no uniformity because each country has developed its own unique approach.Data and transparency seem to be some of the best tools on the road to regulatory certainty and institutional demand. While some countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are taking advantage of this to build a better tax and regulatory framework, others don’t deal with crypto quite as well. India, for example, just recently decided to lift its crypto ban and engage with the sector.Cryptocurrencies are legal in most countries, with Japan being a shining example of progressive legislation. In 2017, the Japanese government became the first country to recognize Bitcoin (BTC) as a currency and to grant official licenses to exchanges, fostering the growth of what was already one of the biggest Bitcoin markets worldwide.There are more examples of countries with crypto-friendly regulations and tax policies, but not all pro-crypto countries have developed legal frameworks quite as favorable as Portugal has, especially when it comes to taxing retail traders.Most countries charge the normal capital gains tax for cryptocurrency profits, such as the U.S. or the U.K., and in many cases filing those taxes can be a nightmare. Florian Wimmer, the CEO and co-founder of Blockpit — a company that offers tax calculation and portfolio tracking for cryptocurrencies — told Cointelegraph:“In most countries crypto is seen as economic goods, like e.g. property and is taxed after existing regulation for such assets. This means that every single transaction is a taxable event.[...] Then there are regulatory differences between certain coins/tokens (especially with securities now) and other ‘special tax events’ like handling hard forks, airdrops, etc. Then you should of course keep track of your assets, and their acquisition time and value, while you move them between your exchange accounts and wallets. I guess you can see where the complexity comes from.”This is where countries like Portugal have very crypto-friendly laws. Although it’s safe to say that digital assets are still largely misunderstood by regulatory entities and the public, one can speculate that some of these entities in Portugal and other countries are willing to provide a friendly foundation for digital assets to grow.Taxes in Portugal before 2017Although crypto taxes in Portugal may now be seen as friendly, allowing retail traders to benefit from a zero-VAT policy wasn’t always the case. In the past, the outlook on Bitcoin and its taxation and regulation was either uncertain or negative. Back in 2013, Banco de Portugal — the country’s central bank — issued a statement warning users of the risks of crypto trading, given the lack of a central authority and “protection fund for depositors/investors.” The statement read:“Since there is no central entity that guarantees the irrevocability and definitiveness of payments, Bitcoin cannot be considered a safe currency, given that there is no certainty in its acceptance as a payment method.”At the end of 2016, the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority released an official document stating that the trading and selling of cryptocurrencies would be subject to value-added tax, declaring:“Cryptocurrencies are not technically considered ‘currency.’ [...] However, they can be exchanged with gains, for real currencies (be it euros, dollars, or another), with companies specialized for that effect. […] As so, cryptocurrencies can generate different types of taxable returns.”In the document, regulators mentioned that winnings obtained through the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies were indeed taxable. At the time, the Ministry of Finance also stated that Bitcoin had no legal framework, but that its earnings were still taxable in the same manner as other tradable assets. However, regulatory entities continued to greatly contradict each other during this time.In 2017, the uncertainty peaked and getting answers regarding the taxation of crypto was not easy. As mentioned in the Portuguese financial publication Jornal de Negócios, the Tax and Customs Authority stated that yes, all trading in Bitcoin is subject to VAT. However, when asked over the phone, the Ministry of Finance stated that the digital currency was not subject to any taxes at all.This confusion stems from the fact that the Tax and Customs Authority wanted to tax Bitcoin-related gains despite the lack of any sort of fiscal legislation, which seemed to have created a sort-of-confusing loophole in reporting taxes on cryptocurrencies.Portugal and Bitcoin: A bumpy road to friendly taxesNow, things are looking much clearer for traders and all those dealing with Bitcoin in Portugal. In December 2017, the Ministry of Finance told Dinheiro Vivo, a Portuguese financial news outlet, that retail trades of Bitcoin would not be taxable and that only income or trades resulting from professional activities would be taxed. A ministry official stated:“The sale of Bitcoins is not taxable under IRS in relation to the Portuguese tax system, namely within the scope of the category E (capitals) or G (gains), except when, due to its habituality, it constitutes a professional or business activity of the taxpayer, in which case it will be taxed in accordance with category B.”To put it simply, a casual retail trader doesn't need to pay taxes for these trades. However, if you’re a company trading Bitcoin as a service or for yourself, or if you are an individual who earns your income from trading activities, you need to pay taxes. When it comes to salaries being paid in Bitcoin or crypto, these are fully taxed the same as they would be with any other currency. But not all countries make it as easy to receive salaries in crypto, as Igor Samohin, a product manager at PaymentX, told Cointelegraph:“When you trade securities or any other financial instruments, you pay taxes. I can assume they do it to popularize crypto, and taxes will come later. That’s good of course. [...] Countries that don’t allow pay salaries in Crypto, are afraid that it's not regulated currencies, and they don’t understand that transactions in Bitcoin, for example, are more transparent than fiat payments with bank cards.”To further cement certainty, the Tax and Customs Authority issued clear guidelines in January 2019 in response to a query regarding Article 68 of its general tax law. Those guidelines provided many answers to common questions related to dealing with Bitcoin. The document sought to answer important questions, such as which documents to fill out in which cases, how to issue cryptocurrency invoices, rules for initial coin offerings, and much more. Jorge Mesquita, the chief operating officer of Universe Coin — a Portugal-based company providing wallet payment terminals — expanded on the matter:“Currently the Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM) evaluates each ICO individually, and they consider that ‘a commitment from the issuer to adopt actions that result in an expectation of financial return to the investors must be present in the qualification of transferable securities,’ which we abide by, and there are no laws or regulations specifically addressing token sales, so we haven’t run into any problems.”But this was not the last time the country would enact favorable legislation in regard to cryptocurrencies. Last year, the Tax and Customs Authority released yet another document that cites a previous 2015 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union, declaring that cryptocurrency payments and mining rewards will not be subject to VAT.Portugal: A new crypto scene?Not taxing Bitcoin can look counterintuitive, as it doesn’t really seem to benefit governments in the short term. But driving the growth of cryptocurrency businesses could be a strong incentive. Many already regard Lisbon as somewhat of a startup and tech hub, with important events like the Web Summit being hosted there.This outlook on cryptocurrencies may be a move to get users interested in trading and to generate more Portugal-based trading venues and other enterprises. Taxing these entities may prove to be more fruitful in the future, and according to Mesquita:“Portugal is a small country in the European Union, considered to be a good testing ground for tech companies, especially startups. [...] Even at a European level, cryptocurrencies aren’t treated as the disruptive innovation they can be and so, Portuguese authorities have stated that cryptocurrency payments are free of VAT, and crypto mining and trading earnings are not subject to income tax, making Portugal an ideal country for crypto users.”The future of crypto in PortugalDespite progressive legislation when it comes to taxes, Portugal has yet to establish a specific regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The activity of issuing and trading digital currencies is still unregulated and unsupervised by the country’s central bank or any other national or European financial authority.The central bank also encourages all credit, payment and electronic currency institutions to refrain from buying, holding or selling cryptocurrencies due to the numerous risks involved.Nevertheless, the progressive attitude of the Portuguese government toward retail cryptocurrency trading and miners is making it very attractive for traders and investors. When asked about how the government benefits from these crypto tax breaks, Wimmer said:“Obviously, they benefit from not having to deal with this complexity themselves too when demanding taxes and controlling people and of course getting people and businesses to relocate to their country and then profit from that in other ways.”All of the above factors create fertile soil for cryptocurrency infrastructure to blossom, possibly rivaling other pro-crypto countries like Malta. However, the implementation of an appropriate legal framework may still be years away and will depend on how the industry and technology progress in the country.Guido Santos, the founder and chief technology officer of Genesis Studio — a Portugal-based provider of blockchain-focused consulting, development and integration services — told Cointelegraph: “We're in a country where regulation only moves forward when the technology does.”"

42096, How Market Volatility Is Shining a Light on DeFi’s Structural Vulnerabilities ,2020-03-28t10:52:00+00:00,2435,143,"On March 12, United States President Donald Trump gave a 10-minute speech on COVID-19 that, coupled with the World Health Organization’s official declaration the day before that the outbreak was now a pandemic, sparked panic across global markets.Investors rushed to the safety of cash, and no cryptocurrency was immune from the mass sell-off. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector plummeted by over 25% in a span of hours. Bitcoin (BTC), despite its reputation as a safe haven, fell by 48% in a span of 24 hours. Ether’s (ETH) loss of 43% was its worst one-day performance.While cryptocurrency prices have rebounded in the interim, the decentralized finance sector has continued to feel the repercussions of “Black Thursday.” As a result of ETH’s sudden losses, millions of dollars' worth of value was liquidated and DeFi applications temporarily stopped functioning.Price volatility is inherent to cryptocurrency investing, but mass liquidations and faulty applications mustn’t become the norm for DeFi. Its foundational philosophy is the removal of centralized intermediaries in the financial system, but this lofty goal will be unobtainable if the mechanics of DeFi are breakable. Crypto assets will always be volatile, and DeFi’s infrastructure must be shored up to withstand day-to-day price changes, no matter how dramatic.Related: DeFi Begins to Move From a Niche Market to Mainstream FinanceAs a starting point, the DeFi community must address three key pain points that are interconnected:The DeFi space is overly reliant on Ethereum assets.Liquidation-based approaches to cross-chain value transfers are dangerous.Multisignature and multiparty computation mechanisms are insufficient for ensuring liveliness and safety in DeFi environments.Each of these points warrants deeper analysis.DeFi’s Ethereum dependence poses systemic risks for the sectorA common mantra in the world of financial advice is to avoid “putting all of your eggs in one basket.” In other words, holding a diversified portfolio ensures that you won’t lose too much money if a particular sector of the economy crashes.In the DeFi sector, all eggs are in Ethereum, which controls the fortunes of DeFi applications and investors alike. For example, users of popular systems like MakerDAO mostly use Ethereum as collateral. When flash crashes of Ether happen, users scramble to recollateralize and the network becomes congested. This makes the DeFi sector uniquely vulnerable to fluctuations in Ether’s price and network congestion. For DeFi systems to scale, these systems need access to larger market-capitalization assets like Bitcoin, as well as a more diverse range of cryptocurrencies.For instance, when ETH’s price tanked on Black Thursday, the outcome was predictably dire. Users of MakerDAO lost millions of dollars (more on that shortly), oracle prices lagged and applications like dYdX and Nuo had to alter their fees to force through delayed trades. This sequence of events was not without precedent: Ethereum’s network suffered similar congestion in 2017. Notwithstanding these problems, Ethereum is and should remain an important cog in the DeFi ecosystem, and the protocol’s plans for ETH 2.0 will hopefully help.Related: Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum 2.0 Roadmap to CointelegraphBut in order to thrive and scale its community, DeFi applications should look toward cross-chain assets enabled by generic interoperability, which would allow collateralization with any crypto asset in return for any other crypto asset. Generic interoperability will provide greater liquidity for DeFi applications, mitigate ETH price exposure risk and lessen DeFi’s dependence on the Ethereum network.Broadening DeFi’s range of cross-chain pairs will be especially important for spurring mass adoption. When stablecoins like Libra, Celo and even China’s digital yuan come online, cross-chain liquidity can serve as a bridge that encourages crypto novices to buy their first Bitcoin, Ether or other decentralized assets as a means of taking out stablecoin loans.A liquidation-based approach to interoperability is dangerousThe Black Thursday experiences of MakerDAO and Compound, two of DeFi’s most popular protocols, offer an instructive case study into why liquidation mechanisms pose risks for DeFi participants.When ETH’s price began plummeting the evening of March 12, MakerDAO’s oracles — the automated bots that ascertain price information for lenders and borrowers — were unable to cope with the speed and severity of the price crash. MakerDAO’s users were desperate to recollateralize their loans, but severe network congestion and outrageously high gas fees prevented them from both depositing more ETH (to maintain their 150-to-100 collateral-to-loan ratio) and paying back their Dai, resulting in $4.5 million of liquidations at absurdly cheap prices for liquidators. Compound suffered similarly with its highest number of liquidations at over $4 million, mostly in collateralized ETH.Beyond Ethereum’s role in this debacle, it is worth focusing on this liquidation-based approach to decentralized finance. When network problems arise, liquidation-based mechanisms can wreak havoc on unsuspecting users. Positions cannot be recollateralized in time, loans cannot be repaid, oracles cannot update their prices, oracle prices lag from the true price, and liquidations stop functioning correctly.This presents a serious challenge for bringing cross-chain assets and liquidity to DeFi. We mustn’t collateralize these assets with ETH or rely on liquidation mechanisms. If we do, DeFi systems might get access to cross-chain assets and liquidity, but we have just moved the risk of dysfunctional liquidation mechanisms somewhere else; we have not actually solved the problem. Worse, if DeFi then goes on to use these cross-chain assets as collateral themselves, then we are compounding liquidation risks. Worse still, the market cap of cross-chain assets becomes restricted by the market cap and volatility of ETH, which defeats much of the point.Related: How EOS and ETH DeFi Made It Through Market TurmoilInstead, DeFi needs cross-chain assets that are collateralized by native tokens whose value is derived only from the use of the assets. This way, the stability and market cap of cross-chain assets is not dependent on anything other than those assets being useful. Such systems do not only survive volatility and market panics, but thrive in them. Decentralized exchanges, which saw historic transaction volume and fee returns during Black Thursday, are an example of this type of system. Despite storing lots of ETH collateral, DEXs remain secure and useful in times of high volatility.Interoperability solutions must go beyond multisigs and MPCWhile both multisigs and multiparty computation mechanisms deserve our praise for bolstering crypto custody, neither are currently sufficient for securing the type of decentralized, always-on network that DeFi is striving toward.Related: Secure Encryption Key Management Modules, ExplainedMultisigs, by virtue of requiring multiple signatures to authorize any transaction, are incapable of scaling or enabling autonomous functions in a large decentralized setting. MPC is preferable and is an important technological breakthrough in securing decentralized networks, but state-of-the-art MPC is vulnerable to going offline when just a few nodes fail, and they have long, heavy pre-compute phases that are incompatible with 24/7 decentralized finance systems.Therefore, to ensure lively and safe decentralized financial services, DeFi protocols must look to novel types of MPC that do not fail when the underlying participants go offline, do not have heavy pre-compute phases, and can remain stable and functional even in times of high market volatility.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Loong Wang is the chief technology officer and co-founder of Ren, an open protocol that enables the permissionless and private transfer of value between blockchains.

42095, Tether Becomes Second Crypto to Launch on Blockchain Futures Platform ,2020-03-28t10:46:00+00:00,6095,94,"As the volume of Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trading continues to rise, the cryptocurrency industry keeps tapping more crypto markets, like stablecoin Tether (USDT), for futures trading.KuMEX, a derivatives arm of IDG-backed crypto exchange, KuCoin, is planning to roll out USDT-margined Bitcoin perpetual contracts on March 30, 2020, the firm officially announced on March 27.KuMEX currently supports only Bitcoin and USDTWhile the new type of futures contract will be launched next week, KuMEX users are already able to deposit USDT via the web or public API starting from March 26, the company said. KuMEX offers crypto derivatives trading up to 100x leverage, according to the announcement.KuCoin told Cointelegraph that Tether will become the second cryptocurrency supported on KuMEX after Bitcoin. In the near future, the firm also plans to support other major cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) for trading on KuMEX.What are perpetual contracts in crypto?By definition, a perpetual contract is a special type of a futures contract — an agreement to buy or sell a crypto asset on a specific future date at a specific price. Unlike the traditional form of futures, a perpetual contract does not have an expiry date while its trading is based on an underlying index price. The index price includes the average price of an asset in line with major spot markets and their relative trading volume.As such, KuMEX’s BTC/USDT spot index will consist of the volume-weighted average price of BTC/USDT across six major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, OKEx and Huobi. The trading volume will be adjusted on a quarterly basis, KuCoin added.Average daily trading volume on KuMEX hits about $100 millionJohnny Lyu, the newly appointed CEO at KuCoin Global, outlined that the USDT perpetual contracts will be “clearer and easier for new futures traders to make investment decisions using USDT.” He states that the contracts will also mitigate the volatility brought by non-pegged tokens.Additionally, the KuCoin team emphasized to Cointelegraph that KuMEX decided to choose USDT as the first stablecoin supported on the platform because the coin is “far more stable” than other coins like Circle's USDC or Paxos’ PAX in terms of market capitalization, liquidity and user recognition.The introduction of USDT perpetual contracts on KuMEX comes as the average daily trading volume of the derivatives platform hit about $100 million, a KuCoin spokesperson told Cointelegraph.Following the trend of the overall growth of crypto derivatives trading, perpetual contracts trading on crypto markets are becoming increasingly popular. As such, Binance, one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges by daily trading volume, reported a significant surge in trading volumes across the exchange’s futures perpetual contracts for January 2020. According to the report, the BTC/USDT perpetual contract was the most popular contract in January, recording nearly a 30% return."
42094, Donald Trump Just ‘Advertised’ Bitcoin After Fed Creates $6 Trillion ,2020-03-28t10:31:00+00:00,135190,686,"Bitcoin (BTC) gained ironic support from United States President Donald Trump on March 27 after he appeared to say he supported manipulating the dollar.In a press conference quoted by various Twitter commentators, including Blockstream CSO, Samson Mow, Trump defended the Federal Reserve printing more than $6 trillion.Trump: the dollar is “our money, our currency”“The beautiful thing about our country is $6.2 trillion — because it is 2.2 plus 4 — it’s $6.2 trillion, and we can handle that easily because of who we are, what we are,” he said.“It’s our money; we are the ones, it’s our currency.”While Trump did not provide any further explanation of his train of thought, he appeared to endorse the Fed providing the astronomical sum of liquidity for the U.S. market. In turn, the dollar supply would be heavily expanded.It is this form of meddling in the money supply that forms a central tenet of Bitcoin as a financial solution. The coronavirus epidemic emboldened its supporters, who watched on as the Fed admitted that it had “infinite” money.“How much did we pay Trump to advertise #Bitcoin?” Mow summarized.Bitcoin versus U.S. 10-year bond returns. Source: Skew.com$6 trillion reality sinks inReactions to the giant $6.2 trillion meanwhile continue to appear, as various cryptocurrency users showed their surprise. Hodlonaut, the organizer of last year’s Lightning Torch transaction relay, argued that under an unlimited money situation, paying taxes made no logical sense.Caitlin Long, the ex-Goldman Sachs executive who subsequently pioneered friendly Bitcoin regulatory approaches in Wyoming, described the monetary intervention as killing capitalism.She also warned that the Fed’s balance sheet would more than double before the coronavirus crisis abated to more than $10 trillion.“In short-term, huge dollar demand bc short-covering, but it won't last,” part of a tweet posted on Friday read.For scale, $6 trillion is the equivalent of the entire U.S. gross domestic product in 1990, or enough to buy almost 70% of the world’s gold supply at spot price."
42093, Most Traders Expect New All-Time High Price for Bitcoin in 2020 ,2020-03-28t09:43:00+00:00,20042,375,"A user poll conducted by Kraken has revealed that most traders are expecting Bitcoin (BTC) to break into new all-time highs before 2021.The poll analyzed the responses of 400 “VIP” crypto traders on Kraken: 41% of respondents described themselves as “investors”, 40% identified as “traders”, and 15% as“institutions” — with the remaining 4% comprising payment processors, crypto exchanges and miners.84% of respondents manage less than $10 million in capital, while 11% manage between $10 million and $50 million. The remaining 6% is divided evenly between traders managing from $50 million to $100 million and traders mobilizing more than $100 million.Traders expect BTC to set record highs this year, not ETHThe survey found that the average BTC price target for 2020 is $22,866. However, traders do not expect Ethereum (ETH) to also see new highs — with $810 comprising the average price target for ETH.The overall market sentiment is slightly bullish, with 44% of participants stating that the cryptocurrency markets are in a bull market, while 22% believe we are in a bear trend and 34% stating they are unsure.There was little consensus among traders as to what will accelerate crypto’s growth over the next 12 months, with the top answer comprising “adoption” with 19%. Bitcoin’s upcoming halving came second with 15%, followed by political “conflict” with 11%, “fear of missing out” with 11%, and economic “crisis” with 9%.Respondents came to a greater agreement regarding the major threats to the industry — with 32% of participants agreeing that “regulation” comprises the biggest risk to crypto, followed by “fraud, hacks, scams” with 23%.Fundamental versus technical analysisFundamental considerations, technical analysis (TA), and fundamental considerations appear to be evenly favored among traders — with 26% describing TA as the primary factor underpinning their trading decisions, 24% looking to the fundamentals, and 23% focusing on overall market sentiment.The state of the global economy and traditional markets influenced the decisions of just under half of respondents, with 55% indicating that mainstream finance has not influenced their decisions regarding crypto in the last six months.Half of the traders expect an altcoin season during 2020Over half of participants predict an altcoin season for 2020 — with 54% answering in the affirmative.The survey also asked respondents to list their five favorite altcoins, with ETH, Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC) and Tezos (XTZ) topping the list.Nearly half of the respondents indicated that they do not use stablecoins, with 44.4%. Tether (USDT) was by far the most popular stablecoin, with 33.6% of users adopting USDT, followed by USD Coin (USDC) with 8.7% and Dai (DAI) with 8.4%."
42092, Peter Vessenes in the Focus of Cointelegraph China ,2020-03-28t09:13:00+00:00,1462,81,"Welcome back to Cointelegraph China’s Focus talk show. This time around, Peter Vessenes is under the spotlight. He is the founder of CoinLab, the first venture-backed Bitcoin company. He also co-founded the Bitcoin Foundation, serving as its first executive director and chairman.Vessenes has provided digital-currency consulting services for entities including the United States Treasury Department, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. He serves as the chief cryptographer for the Deluge Network and Metronome, a project that aims to create a “politics-free digital currency.”Cointelegraph: You were the first one to have talked with the U.S. Treasury Department about Bitcoin. What is the story behind it, and what exactly did they discuss with you that first time?Peter Vessenes: In the early days, governments were trying to get their heads around Bitcoin, and things were so decentralized it wasn't really clear who even to talk to. The Bitcoin Foundation filled that role for a while in a critical time in the industry's development. We were invited out originally to meet with FinCEN, which is the Anti-Money Laundering enforcement section of the Treasury Department, headed by Jennifer Shasky Calvery at that time.They were most worried about and interested in the enforcement side of Bitcoin: knowing what was happening, who was doing what and so on. Ms. Calvery said something I'll never forget: ""We think the toothpaste is out of the tube."" She proceeded to explain her rough idea was to acknowledge they couldn't stop Bitcoin from being a thing, and they would try and work with already regulated entities at the on- and off-ramps for enforcement.This, it turned out, was a really good strategy. It let some early Bitcoin businesses and funds get a commanding lead: Coinbase, Kraken and Pantera all had the regulatory space to work on business models without major fear.I would say the SEC has done much worse by American business in the most recent round of innovation, regulating with a much heavier hand, and we see the results with exchanges like Binance worth billions of dollars, but staying out of the U.S.CT: Many traditional companies are now working on cryptocurrency, but on the other hand, the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to place obstacles before the Libra stablecoin, and it hasn’t warmly welcomed crypto exchange-traded fund applicants, either. What is the exact problem you think the crypto companies need to solve? And what is the SEC or the government looking for?PV: Government agencies that I've worked with are mostly concerned with serious enforcement worries, really objectionable activities, by which I mean things I wish I had never heard were happening and certainly will not repeat. I found this comforting. In 2012, it wasn't clear if there would be sort of “petty” enforcement in the U.S. outside of the SEC. In the U.S., we haven't seen much of that, although perhaps IRS subpoenas of Coinbase records come close.In general, most agencies I've worked with were filled with good people working on good things, and they almost all — big secret — own crypto themselves.As far as companies solving problems: financial inclusion, open access, destruction of rent-seeking behavior by long-standing financial industry participants — those are all pretty good goals. I'll give you a hint, though, and say that JPMorgan won't be destroying rent-seeking behavior, no matter how innovative its crypto group is.SEC behavior is complex, and it's good to remember that the U.S. has multiple regulatory agencies overseeing complex financial products; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is another. So, you have a mix of internal regulator incentives, including expanding their own remit vis-a-vis other agencies, American imperialism, etc., and then you also have some what I'd call ""good"" motivations, like protecting citizens from scams, Ponzi schemes and so on.I think we'll continue to see real innovation happening in fits and starts in areas that are as lightly regulated as possible. It's just so very expensive, risky and time-consuming to try to innovate in America on the financial side. I really can't emphasize enough the benefits of a lighter regulatory regime for innovation. It's very important.CT: The Bitcoin Foundation was one of the most prominent organizations in the ecosystem.So, how do you see its failings with respect to its governance, transparency and finances?PV: Leaving the Bitcoin Foundation was bittersweet. In the beginning, I wanted it to be a place that built the good brand reputation for Bitcoin globally and provided a venue for both industry and individuals to do some collective work together.It was sweet because it was clear that my idea had been right: There was real demand to organize and work together. Bitter because I failed to bring the best quality leadership to the top of the organization. Two board members went to prison. A third had been accused of crimes, but not tried. I worked hard to try to clear out influencers that I thought shouldn't be there. But in the end, I couldn't keep the leadership at a level I felt good about and decided to leave.There won't be another thing like the foundation in our industry, but I'm still glad I launched it with Gavin Andresen and would do it again, although I would change how we chose board leadership and make it more international from the very beginning.CT: Regarding Mt. Gox, as previously reported, roughly 24,000 creditors are thought to have been affected by the 2011 hack and subsequent collapse in early 2014. It was said you own a stake of Mt Gox and you have submitted a $16 billion claim in the Mt. Gox civil rehabilitation, which is considered an obstacle for other creditors. Can you explain the issue here?PV: Unfortunately, since we are still in litigation seven years later, I can't talk a lot. I will say that we have been diligently and aggressively pushing for a real trial this whole time so that we can get a fair ruling. It looks like we will be getting that trial in Tokyo this year, pending coronavirus slowdowns. So, that's great.“Right now, all creditors — including us — are waiting on the trustee to make a payment plan that can be reviewed. Believe me, we would love to see one as much as any other creditor.”We have had a fair amount of interest from investors and other creditors trying to buy into the lawsuit as a way to hedge out their own risks in the bankruptcy and ideally achieve good returns. So, we may look into providing access to the suit to a broader group of investors in the future, all still TBD.CT: As a cryptographic expert, how do you summarize the technology development of blockchain in these 10 years? After proof-of-work, different consensus mechanisms have appeared, like proof-of-stake, delegated proof-of-stake, practical Byzantine fault tolerance,, etc. What do you think of them? And are there any projects that excite you with their technology?PV: The last project that really got me excited technically was Ethereum. Not to say we haven't seen interesting innovation since then, but it was a massive leap over Bitcoin. We just closed a blockchain fund — Capital 6 Eagle — with my partner in China, and I can tell you what I'm investing in:Fundamental infrastructure that makes decentralized ledger technology faster and cheaper. We need two or three orders of magnitude faster tech. So, this will change things as it shows up.Stablecoin projects and asset tokenization technologies.Identity projects.Secure data on chainsWallet and other access infrastructure.Decentralized exchange technology.A crazy paper last year that really got me thinking was the MAST paper out of Blockstream. They provided a way to have provable computation using only software. It's very, very slow, but the idea is profound and interesting for verifiability.CT: You started to pay attention to smart contracts in 2014, and you set up New Alchemy in 2016. What is the main plan for you this year?PV: I'm launching a new project that has been a secret so far, but this can be the announcement: It's a Bitcoin paper-currency project. Unlike some of the other hardware-wallet projects, we are working on having a chip embedded directly into a paper bill. We will have a series of announcements, but we are working with a major global currency producer and have an agreement with one of the best currency designers in the world to make these bills. It's just so very hard to deal with crypto, and I want to give access to regular people to have, hold and trade it.Finally, we're working on launching a Shenzhen incubator, probably in the third quarter. So, that should be really exciting. I love the energy and pace of business in China and want to provide mentorship, capital and advice to another generation of Chinese entrepreneurs. So, that's really exciting.CT: You are also interested in security token offerings. You said in 2018 that there would be a large circulation of STOs in the future, but they haven’t made much progress. What do you think about it now?PV: On STOs: I was obviously wrong about timing, which is the same thing as being wrong. The difficulties in the last few years have been the intersection of the technology, the regulatory pace and the crash all together. Plus, early STOs offered in the U.S. were just bad offerings, poorly priced and definitely worse for the buyer than comparable publicly traded products or crypto products — or both.But I do sort of stand by my prediction, too. Over the years, I believe more and more in the idea of permissionless innovation. STOs necessarily bridge regulated and unregulated worlds, and this is a really hard space because of that interaction. But, I still do believe that we will see tokenized offerings with regulatory oversight.CT: One time you mentioned that you feel a “nostalgia” about the early times when Bitcoin was purely decentralized and only was mined by personal computers. Do you think that the modern ecosystem is the right way for the industry to develop?PV: If I could wave a wand, I would definitely do away with industrial mining. It's a very hard problem to do away with, though. I think mining is not in a stable position right now, though. There will be more innovation on business models. For instance, during the BCH–BTC war, I thought it very interesting that companies like Coinbase used their user platforms to advocate for what they wanted. Why hadn't they invested in mining so that they could actually control voting on the outcome?The answer to that question is at least partly regulatory, by the way, both for Coinbase and their investors, but it's also social; a matter of how different people think of mining. Miners have generally historically not used their influence for more than making money, or at least usually in very soft ways, and this is probably not quite what Satoshi wanted.CT: In early 2018, you said that innovations in the industry should be measured by the question: “What percent of the total innovation that’s going to be done has been done?” And your answer was less than 5%. Do you think we are at the same stage now?PV: I still think we have a lot of innovation left to do, and in fact, I wouldn't say anything super material has shown up in the last two years. We're seeing infrastructure build out right now, which is good. But we need another Vitalik and Gav, or we need one of them to pull a Linus Torvalds and do Git on top of Linux.CT: What would you say to Satoshi Nakamoto if you were to meet?PV: What makes you think I haven't?To Satoshi, I'd say thank you, we got the leader we needed, luckily not the leader we deserved."

If this effort fails then a retest of $5,800 and $5,350 is possible.Over the short term, Bitcoin price needs to first retake $6,200 then push above the high volume VPVR node at $6,335 in order to re-reach the $6,500 range.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph contributor filbfllb commented that the likelihood of Bitcoin price reaching $10,000 before May is slim to none. filbfilb explained that:“Bitcoin is trading up against what is a fundamental decision point at $6.8K. This is previous support now acting as resistance and the top of a high volume node which is dissected by a diagonal resistance trend line, which dates back to mid-2019.”According to filbfilb, Bitcoin price is approaching a pivotal moment and:“If the bulls are unable to regain the $6,800 level, the 200-week moving average is lying below at around $5,500 on a high volume node, which was previously front run in the last attempt to break $6,800.

42090, India Crypto Renaissance: Industry Sees Rebirth as RBI Crypto Ban Lifts ,2020-03-28t05:13:00+00:00,6686,161,"Among industry participants and investors, India is emerging as a market to watch for following the overturn of a crypto ban that was placed by the Reserve Bank of India back in April 2018. The prominent investors looking to get a piece of India’s nascent crypto space include Tim Draper, a billionaire investor who obtained thousands of Bitcoin from 2014’s Silk Road auction.Draper recently said that he has “met several Bitcoin and crypto startups” from India and that he “hopes to be able to fund a number of them.” He also recently showed his excitement for the move by the Supreme Court of India in striking down the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on financial institutions providing crypto related services, tweeting, “A Renaissance for India. Now crypto is legal.”Local firms spring into actionApart from Draper, other investors who have shown interest in India’s crypto market include crypto exchange CoinDCX. On March 12, CoinDCX announced $1.3 million in funding that would be used to increase crypto awareness and adoption in India. The exchange is looking to spearhead a long-term project called TryCrypto in an effort to introduce 50 million consumers in India to cryptocurrencies.CoinDCX was established in 2018 and already boasts of a recently closed Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital, HDR Group (BitMex operators) and Bain Capital Ventures, to mention just a few.The Mumbai-based exchange secured $3 million in funding, to which its CEO Sumit Gupta said, “This successful investment round will go a long way in funding our vision of accelerating India’s growth into a $5 trillion economy.”Also convinced of the potential held by India’s crypto market is Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. In November last year, Binance purchased WazirX, an Indian crypto exchange. The move was applauded by Indian crypto experts such as Kashif Raza as one that will give “a morale boost to India’s startup scene.”With the backing of Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance USD (BUSD), WazirX has set up $50 million in funds intended to go to local blockchain projects. CEO Nischal Shetty said, “With this fund, we want to encourage and enable more and more founders and teams to come in and build. This initiative also shows the incredible potential that the Indian blockchain ecosystem has to offer.”What makes India’s crypto space ripe for investment?It is evident that the recent interest from investors and companies toward India’s crypto market is as a result of the March 4 ruling by India’s Supreme Court. The ban that had previously been placed by the Reserve Bank of India on all crypto-related bank services was declared unconstitutional, much to the reprieve of the country’s crypto community. However, in addition to the court ruling, industry watchers and experts believe there is more to India than a seemingly positive regulatory environment.Sharat Chandra, an advisor on emerging technologies, believes that what makes India a good market for a crypto renaissance is the fact that the country is home to nearly 190 million unbanked individuals.Chandra told Cointelegraph that, “Crypto startups can bring those unbanked into the banking fold and further the cause of financial inclusion.” He added, “India retains the top spot when it comes to foreign remittances, and crypto can not only reduce turnaround time but bring down remittance costs drastically.” Gupta agrees with Chandra, pointing out to Cointelegraph:“India has 1.3 billion population out of which only 5 million are in crypto, which equates to 0.4%. Even with 0.4% of the people in crypto, Indian crypto market has a good volume of daily crypto trading. CoinDCX is witnessing daily volume of $10–15 million, which shows that there is huge potential for growth.”Dileep Seinberg, the CEO and founder at Exioms — a Delhi-based blockchain solutions provider — also weighed in on the matter, telling Cointelegraph:“India has 3 key elements that make it a good and large market. First, the young generation of users who can operate and trust the internet and mobile-based Apps for financial transactions. Second is penetration of 4G and faster internet services everywhere in India and third is the access of smartphones at very low cost.”Not yet out of the woodsDespite the optimism shared by India’s crypto community, regulatory uncertainty still persists. According to Sharat Chandra, “The war against RBI’s cryptocurrency ban was on flimsy grounds and the RBI can very well challenge the verdict of the Supreme Court of India.”Already, the reserve bank of India is planning to file a petition against the recent ruling by the Supreme Court on the controversial crypto ban. A report by the Economic Times shows that the RBI fears a crypto renaissance in the country threatens the country’s banking system. Furthermore, the ruling on a pending bill by India’s parliament can still introduce an exclusionary legislative apparatus for crypto and blockchain related businesses.Related: Bitcoin Price Correlates With Traditional Assets, but Not EntirelyTo add to all this, the current coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow on the entire crypto market as well as the global economy. Chandra, however, believes that people are optimistic, even if the recovery in digital asset prices might take longer than expected. Gupta opined that, “Less than 1% of the global world population is in crypto assets. This means the crypto market is largely uncorrelated to major global assets in the world such as stocks, bonds etc.” He added:“We have seen a downward trend in crypto market prices after the Covid pandemic but people still have faith in crypto and are dealing and investing in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s hashrate is still at 105 Ehash/s which shows people continue to believe in Bitcoin. And as Bitcoin drives the overall crypto market in terms of prices, this proves people have faith in the crypto market.”Full steam ahead?Despite a lingering cloud over the future of cryptocurrencies in India, industry watchers like Seinberg and Gupta share optimism that a bright future is around the corner. Seinberg believes:“Going forward in the next 2–3 years, India will have its own Cryptocurrency at the place. RBI is focusing on Innovation and NPCI has already launched Vajra Blockchain Platform for wider adoptions.”Seinberg also believes that, “The recent visit of Tim Draper to India and the commitment of new investments will inspire and build confidence on Indian Institutional Investors.” On the other hand, Gupta said that winning the court case is just the first step, adding, “Now, the next big push is to incorporate smart and sensible crypto regulations in India.” With emerging reports of plans by the Indian government to regulate cryptocurrencies, Gupta believes:“This is the step in the right direction as having correct regulations in place will help to open up and boost many crypto businesses in India. Additionally, individuals will be open to investing in cryptocurrencies.”"

This will be his seventh birthday in incarceration.Ulbricht is the convicted felon serving two life sentences plus 40 years for his role in creating the Silk Road, the online contraband market notorious for its associations with cryptocurrency. Ulbricht says Silk Road was initially envisioned as a libertarian paradise, but it eventually went sideways:“Silk Road was supposed to beabout giving people the freedom to make their own choices, to pursue their own happiness, however they individually saw fit. What it turned into was, in part, a convenient way for people to satisfy their drug addictions.”This free market utopia lasted about two years from Ulbricht’s founding it in 2011. He was arrested by the FBI in October 2013 and has been in custody ever since. At trial he was found guilty of money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. His double life sentence comes without any chance of parole.Since Ulbricht’s arrest and sentencing, many of the biggest names in the crypto community have spoken out in support of Ulbricht, suggesting that the legal system treated him with prejudice. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper has consistently voiced support for Ulbricht, and an online petition to the White House calling for Ulbricht’s release gathered its 275,000th signature this week."
42082, Telegram Seeks Clarity On The Preliminary Injunction Against TON ,2020-03-27t23:15:00+00:00,2960,68,"How far can a preliminary injunction from an American court reach? The answer to that question is everything for Telegram’s embattled TON blockchain project.TON has been under legal fire since shortly after the SEC became aware of its token sale. The drama is ongoing as recently as this week, when a federal district court judge issued a preliminary injunction against Telegram for its ten-figure initial coin offering. The allegation is that Telegram’s GRAM token, operating on the TON blockchain, was illegally being sold as a security, and the judge effectively took the SEC’s side on the case.Filing an opinion with the New York Southern District Court, Judge P. Kevin Castel wrote this week that “the SEC has shown a substantial likelihood of success in proving that Telegram’s present plan to distribute Grams is an offering of securities under the Howey test.""The Howey test is a legal yardstick used to determine if a financial instrument meets the definition of a security — to pass the Howey test is to be named a security (and therefore be subject to regulation).Now Telegram’s lawyers are firing back with their own paperwork in order to learn more. They wrote a letter to the judge to ask about the injunction in detail.(The) Defendants respectfully seek to clarify whether the scope of the preliminary injunction set forth in the Order applies only to Purchase Agreements with U.S.-based investors. We appreciate the Court’s attention to this matter and are available should the Court require more information regarding this request.In other words, their question is: does this injunction apply only to ICO investors based in the US, or to everyone?Telegram raised $1.7 billion during its ICO, and a distinct majority of that money came from outside US borders. If the injunction only applies to US-based investors, it’s theoretically feasible for Telegram to launch TON anyway without American money."
42081, US Holding Firm Halted Mining Business After Bitcoin Crashed Below $4K ,2020-03-28t03:00:00+00:00,11944,110,"Although the cryptocurrency markets have slightly recovered following massive sell-offs in mid-March, Bitcoin’s (BTC) faltering price has led to notable miner instability and closures.Soon after Bitcoin dropped below the $4,000 threshold on March 13, DPW Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed holding company, announced that it is temporarily shutting down its cryptocurrency mining business, Digital Farms.DPW notifies the SEC about multiple changes to its business in relation to the coronavirusAccording to a March 18 business update filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), the Digital Farms’ suspension comes alongside other closures and changes at DPW in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.However, while changes at other businesses at DPW are directly connected to the impact of COVID-19, Digital Farms is said to be suspended due to Bitcoin’s recent price crash. The filing reads:“Digital Farms’ cryptocurrency mining operations have been suspended indefinitely, primarily due to the sharp decline in the market price for Bitcoin.”Formerly known as Super Crypto Mining, Digital Farms is a wholly owned crypto mining subsidiary of DPW. As reported by Cointelegraph, Digital Farms deployed DPW’s own mining hardware, AntEater, which was developed in collaboration with tech giant, Samsung. In May 2019, Digital Farms acquired a 617,000 square foot facility in the U.S. to increase overall mining profitability by gaining access to 28 megawatts of power and an infrastructure to support up to 300 megawatts.Digital Farms on hold 60 days before the next Bitcoin halvingDigital Farms’ suspension announcement came just about 60 days before the next Bitcoin halving in May — one of the most anticipated events in the crypto community, which will see mining rewards cut by 50%. Taking place once every four years, the Bitcoin halving has historically led to significant growth in Bitcoin’s price. However, some crypto players believe that the next Bitcoin halving will have little-to-no impact on Bitcoin’s price.Though some factions of the crypto community were anticipating Bitcoin to surge amid the upcoming halving, Bitcoin experienced exactly the opposite trend in March 2020. On March 13, Bitcoin’s price “halved” its price instead, dropping to as low as $3,600. At the height of the crash, the coin’s daily losses amounted to over 50%.A number of miners apparently shut down operations due to unprofitability after the crashThe massive drop of Bitcoin subsequently led to significant miner instability as mining became unprofitable. This forced a number miners to remove their hashing power from the network, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode reported. Similarly, Chinese mining pool, F2Pool, also reported on March 12 that Bitcoin’s daily mining revenue was suffering more losses than during the price lows of November and December 2018.When some miners retreated due to unprofitability following the crash, Bitcoin experienced its second-largest historical drop in difficulty ever. According to Glassnode data, Bitcoin’s difficulty — a measure that indicates the time taken by miners to add new transactions to the Bitcoin network — dropped almost 16% on March 25. While some industry players think that downward difficulty adjustment completes the so-called “miners’ capitulation cycle,” others are confident that such events mark a bottom in the market.As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $6,652, up about 0.2% over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coin360."
42080, Blockchain Jobs Continue to Rise Despite Global Recession ,2020-03-28t01:00:00+00:00,6097,200,"Trillions of dollars have been injected into the global markets in an attempt to revitalize the world economy. The U.S. alone recently hit its highest unemployment rate in history.The whole world seems to be falling apart except for blockchainKraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, is looking to increase its job force by 10%, despite the recent dips in crypto price, according to Forbes on March 26.Kraken’s team, currently 800 members strong, is adding an additional 67 hires to the company over the coming weeks. Many of the company’s openings are for people who are hospitality professionals with skill sets focused around the liberal arts.Indeed.com displayed approximately 114.5 per million blockchain-centric jobs last December, right before the first new coronavirus case was reported. By February 2020 that number had increased 3% to 118.4 per million.Optimism In Blockchain Industry Booms Despite Global RecessionBlockchain industry experts are bullish towards the crypto market. Jihan Wu, Founder of Bitcoin mining giant Bitman, gave his first interview of 2020 at a Chinese blockchain media event, revealing his continued optimism for a crypto market bull run over the coming year. He explained that:“There are two reasons: first, from China and its neighboring countries experiences, coronavirus can be obtained and taken under control in about 2 months. Secondly, countries around the world are adopting great quantitative easing monetary policies.”Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, also stated on Twitter yesterday that Bitcoin is the “only vaccine in the world that can give you immunity to the money printing disease.”Cointelegraph reported previously that blockchain will be the most in-demand hard skill in 2020, along with cloud computing, analytical reasoning, and artificial intelligence."
42079, Russian Police Take Down an Illegal Bitcoin Mining Farm ,2020-03-27t23:00:00+00:00,5043,78,"Russian police have caught Bitcoin miners who were stealing $200,000 worth of electricity each month in their efforts to mine cryptocurrency.According to a statement released by the Russian Interior Ministry, a Saint Petersburg suspect has been arrested, along with nine alleged accomplices.The criminals managed to install sophisticated infrastructure that connects mining equipment to the country’s electricity supply at eight different locations, the Interior Ministry stated.Seized elements during the raidsIn total, the Russian National Guard seized 1,500 pieces of mining equipment, 2 million rubles, smartphones that contained incriminating messages, and 100 altered electrical meters over the course of 20 searches.The miners used an abandoned building to conceal most of their mining machinery, according to the statement, as well as several residential properties, located in Lekoslovo, Vsevolozhsk, and Roshchino.Mined cryptocurrencies sent to foreign exchangesAccording to Irina Volk, the official spokesperson for the Russian Interior Ministry, the mined cryptocurrencies were sent to exchanges located outside of Russia, and then converted to cash.The news comes after a story Cointelegraph reported on December 17, 2019, concerning two Russian citizens who were prosecuted for allegedly targeting computers at state organizations to illegally mining cryptocurrencies.Also, on February 17, investigators in Ukraine accused an IT executive of the Kyiv Prosecutor’s Office of mining cryptocurrencies illegally using systems owned by the government."
42078, Bitcoin Ascends on Twitter While Major Altcoins Hit Multi-Year Lows ,2020-03-27t22:00:00+00:00,4447,126,"Major altcoins have seen their Twitter presence greatly reduced in the wake of the recent cryptocurrency market crash. According to data from Bitinfocharts, major altcoins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and XRP now find their Twitter mentions nearing two and even three-year lows.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Twitter presence doubled in the first three months of 2020, though its tweet count remains a long way off of its 2017 all-time high.XRP tweets hit 21 month lowEarlier this week, on March 21st, tweets bearing the hashtag #XRP numbered 2,542. That’s a 60% drop since January 2020 alone, when XRP tweets ranged between 6,000 and 7,000.The last time XRP’s daily tweet count fell as low as 2,500 was in July 2018, almost 21 months ago.XRP’s all-time high Twitter surge didn’t come during the 2017-2018 bull run, unlike most other coins. Instead, the peak of XRP Twitter engagement to date remains September 21st, 2018, when XRP was tweeted out 20,000 times according to Bitinfocharts.As readers may recall, that date coincides with the first whispers regarding the then-rumoured launch of Ripple Labs’ xRapid - an XRP-based payment solution for financial institutions. Boosted by the much anticipated product launch, the price of XRP almost tripled in the week leading up to September 21st.Litecoin reverts to 2 year tweet lowWhen daily Litecoin tweets fell as low as 344 earlier this month, it was the lowest Twitter engagement witnessed on behalf of Litecoin since March 2017.That was the month in which Litecoin began its ascension leading up to its 2018 bull run. Between March and May of 2017 alone, the price of LTC increased ten times over, from $3 to $30.From there, both the coin’s price and Twitter engagement continued climbing up and up. Remarkably, Litecoin’s return to the Twitter doldrums coincides with its fall back to the aforementioned $30 range.Currently, Litecoin tweets currently number just 1.3% of their previous all-time high of 31,000.Ethereum tweets down 95% from peakFollowing a similar trend, Ethereum’s Twitter presence is at one of its lowest ebbs in over three years. Currently numbering around 2,500, Ethereum’s tweet-count has only sunk this low once in the past three years - that being New Year’s Day of 2020.Barring that dip, the last time ETH’s Twitter engagement fell so low was February of 2017. That was also the month in which ETH began a 60-day, 5x increase which carried the coin price from $10 to $50.From December 2017’s peak of 51,000 tweets in one 24-hour period, Ethereum’s Tweet-count has fallen over 95%.Bitcoin sees twitter resurgence in 2020Bitcoin’s Twitter engagement on March 26th amounted to 24,722 tweets. That’s a substantial drop from December 2017’s peak of 155,000, but unlike most altcoins, Bitcoin has shown a resurgent Twitter trend in 2020.After recording as little as 12,000 tweets back in January of this year, Bitcoin tweets have since more than doubled.Searching for reasons why, one might assume that Bitcoin’s lesser drop in value compared to most altcoins has something to do with it. After all, social media engagement surrounding cryptocurrencies tends to follow price.However, another cause could be the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, which reignited discussion surrounding Bitcoin’s value as a safe-haven asset."
42077, Back From the Crypt: MakerDAO Toes the Line Between Life and Death ,2020-03-27t21:20:00+00:00,2711,67,"The crypto industry is young, and in emerging tech, a handful of companies often lead the charge. For those holding equity in these companies, this is generally considered something to be encouraged. For everyone else, it is not.The recent rise of decentralized finance has been no different, and the company holding the torch is MakerDAO. When market conditions are favorable, these powerful companies can be trailblazers for the industry. However, if they face an existential threat, they can drag the entire sector down with them.To say that the COVID-19 pandemic is a black swan now seems like an understatement. With one beat of its wings, the black swan felled markets, economies and created unemployment at the speed the likes of which the world has never seen. The steady spread of the virus, along with the mixed responses from companies and governments alike, created widespread uncertainty — kryptonite for the global markets.Crypto prices also plummeted, with some arguing that the level of institutional investment causes an unavoidable connection to mainstream financial assets, while others argue that in a time of crisis, nervous investors simply sell everything. It was only a matter of time before the shockwaves from the growing financial crisis got to MakerDAO.Crash: MakerDAO feels the heatOn March 12, Ether (ETH) prices dropped over the cliff edge, slipping 30% in 24 hours. Suddenly, MakerDAO’s decentralized protocol was left with millions of dollars in debt from under-collateralized lending. It looked as if the company had been dealt a fatal blow. The firm briefly considered an emergency shutdown.Dai (DAI), Maker’s in-house stablecoin, is priced against the dollar. Dai is minted by users taking on collateralized debt positions, where collateral is deposited in an Ethereum smart-contract, with a percentage of the asset’s value being paid out in Dai. The collateral then gets released once the tokens are repaid, and the Dai are destroyed. Loans that can’t be supported by their collateral are placed into liquidation proceedings, in which the collateral is auctioned for Dai to repay the debt. But the price drop allowed bidders to win liquidation auctions for 0 DAI — further worsening Maker’s crisis.As March 13 rolled around, the company had time to assess the damage from the day before. It seemed like MakerDAO bosses saw a glimmer of hope and called for a community vote ahead of the company’s first-ever debt auction.At the time of the auction, MakerDAO’s financial woes had widened to around $5 million in under-collateralized debt. A blog post from Maker laid bare the sorry state of affairs at the firm:“The MakerDAO had a +500k$ surplus before the price drop, and now has a -4M$ surplus that needs to be filled. The protocol covers this issue, the solution being to trigger an MKR mint and auction, the DAI raised being used to fill the surplus debt. During normal operation, MKR is burned when debt from vaults is reimbursed, this would be the opposite mechanism.”Commentators circle, but most are optimisticThe crypto community often bays for blood when companies make mistakes. However, it appears that MakerDAO has garnered itself a soft spot in the hearts of the industry’s commentators nonetheless. In other cases, while technical flaws and sudden losses can create calls for boycotts of companies and cause people to take sides, the response from other crypto figures toward Maker has been largely supportive.Alex Melikhov, CEO of EOSDT, a DeFi company, explained to Cointelegraph that MakerDAO’s recent troubles are of a technical nature, rather than economic: “These circumstances showed off the lack of redundancy in the MakerDAO’s system and weaknesses in the Ethereum network capacity.”Although Melikhov’s analysis of the debt debacle laid blame on the technical side of the operation, he also had some pointed criticism of the proprietary oracle MakerDAO uses for price feeds, which did not hold up under the deluge of pending transactions:“As a result, the on-chain prices in the system were remaining outdated in a period of significant price movement — $166/ETH on-chain instead of $133/ETH on the market.”According to Melikhov, this created something of a “perfect storm” for MakerDAO. The firm’s keepers weren’t interested in buying ETH at a 20% market premium — a stark change from the usual 3% discount. Meanwhile, Kain Warwick, founder of Synthetix and CEO of blueshyft, struck a more optimistic note, arguing that while the price drop exposed underlying issues in DeFi, Ethereum’s fundamental qualities are still strong:“This recent downturn has been a macro trend driven by uncertainty, so this short-term price action on ETH doesn’t reflect the long-term viability of the network. We've definitely seen some teething problems over the last 24 hours as protocols have experienced shocks due to the price action.”The question of security looms large over the DeFi sector. Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of Aave, another fellow DeFi company, recently opined that “we used to have nerds attacking the system, now we have nerds with money.” MakerDAO’s Gustav Arentoft echoed the issues of security on stage at London Blockchain Week:“It’s a difficult field. We have bigger responsibility when building the system, as the code is completely public. We have limited time to build the system. Hackers have unlimited time to research the code and create hacks. And that’s the hardest thing to beat.”Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis also expressed skepticism about the level of security in January — prior to any hacks or particular technical flaws being exposed — stating it is “impossibly optimistic to say there won’t be a confidence shaking bug before DeFi gets big.”Maker deals with the situationMakerDAO’s all-important debt auction drew to a close on March 23, with a total of $4.3 million worth of under-collateralized Dai that was bid across two phases. While there was initially some criticism about Maker’s lack of decisive action at the time the firm was mulling over an emergency shutdown, the community was mostly optimistic about the firm’s handling of the situation.To begin with, it looked like the auction was going to be a flop. As 20 minutes elapsed, only two bids had been made. One community member wrote: “I can’t wait to tell my grandkids about this.” Maker’s last gasp was in danger of falling flat.However, several days prior to the auction, a “backstop syndicate” had been formed. The syndicate would swoop in and act as a last-resort buyer if the price fell below 100 DAI. The syndicate was made up of community members, along with Framework Ventures’s Michael Anderson, reversing his previous position on MakerDAO. Anderson told Cointelegraph that his decision was to ensure the stability of DeFi as a whole, again showing how intricately linked the fate of the sector is to its largest company.Maker takes important step toward further decentralizationIn a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Gustav Arentoft, European business development representative at MakerDAO, explained that DeFi projects will often have a thorny relationship with the concept of decentralization in their early stages, stating that if projects are decentralized from day one, they open themselves up to a lot of attack vectors in the system.Arentoft also explained that while MakerDAO fully supports decentralization in the sector, it is taking the approach of gradual decentralization. He told Cointelegraph that decentralization in DeFi does not need to be a binary position: “I don't personally believe that it’s binary in the sense that you are either decentralized or you're like traditional finance.”But as the dust settles from the debt crisis, MakerDAO is handing over governance for the smart contract that underpins the firm’s protocol to MKR token holders. As the driving force of the whole DeFi sector, the move is a significant step toward decentralized governance.Although the three-month transition of power to the community has been finalized, the foundation urged the Maker community to “remain deeply engaged and continue to vote smartly and often,” stating that voter apathy could threaten the project:“While voter apathy can threaten any election process, it can do harm to a project’s decentralization efforts. Without enough community passion and well-intentioned participation, a community-governed system can become vulnerable and struggle to succeed.”Chief Executive of the Maker Foundation Rule Christensen said that the company was fast moving toward complete decentralization:“By completing its commitment to transfer the MKR token contract to MKR holders, the Maker Foundation continues to move toward a completely self-sustaining MakerDAO. And it’s just the beginning. We will continue to ready the community for complete decentralization in the weeks and months ahead.”"

42070, No Evidence of Crypto-Related Charge in Maduro Drug Cases ,2020-03-27t18:30:00+00:00,3309,74,"Several Venezuelan leaders recently came under fire for alleged criminal acts, although, contrary to initial impressions, the situation did not directly involve cryptocurrency usage.“Maduro and his co-defendants are not alleged to have been involved with crypto, directly,” Ashok Ayyar, counsel at Experience Legal, told Cointelegraph.A number of Venezuelan officials, including former president Maduro, faced a slew of charges from U.S. governing bodies, according to a March 26 statement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). Despite the press release announcing the charges touting the Homeland Security Investigations’ ability to track cryptocurrency transactions, a close examination of the DoJ’s indictments reveals no direct mention of cryptocurrency or blockchain usage as part of criminal allegations against Maduro or his cohorts.“The Indictment extends from 2014-2019 and involved funds flowing through US banks,” Joshua Garcia, partner at Blakemore Fallon legal practice, told Cointelegraph via email, adding:“My sense is if Petro was involved it was only involved later in the scheme, and it‘s unlikely any US banks directly touched the crypto, so an intermediary like bitcoin might have been used at some point (pure speculation).”Crypto is sometimes unnecessarily affiliated with criminal activityNumerous headlines have affiliated cryptocurrency with criminal activity over the years, making the asset class an easy scapegoat for financial crimes, even where no correlation exists.“There is no allegation in the indictments that the Petro or any other crypto was specifically involved,” Coinsource general counsel Arnold Spencer told Cointelegraph.Spencer added:“The statement in the press release from HSI officials is not supported by the indictments (which is a violation of DOJ policy). Why do US officials try to vilify crypto when there is no allegation that crypto is involved in the alleged conspiracy?”Crimes by the country’s officials came before the PetroVenezuela has appeared in a number of blockchain-relevant headlines over the past two years. Most recently, the country released its own national crypto asset, the Petro, in the midst of soaring national inflation.“The Maduro indictment suggests the money laundering by the cartel long pre-dates the Petro and other Venezuelan sanctions, stretching all the way back to 1999,” Ayyar explained. “The Petro likely became part of the money-laundering scheme more recently, but that is not the only cause of this indictment.”The only crypto references include broad mentionIn fact, the DoJ’s statement includes only two passing cryptocurrency references, but neither are substantially linked to any of the department’s specific charges.Homeland Security Investigations Acting Executive Associate Director, Alysa Erichs, mentioned a broad reference of crypto, as part of her department’s overall initiatives. Erichs said:“Today’s announcement highlights HSI’s global reach and commitment to aggressively identify, target and investigate individuals who violate U.S. laws, exploit financial systems, and hide behind cryptocurrency to further their illicit criminal activity.”The other mention of crypto sits at the bottom of the statementThe only other direct crypto reference comes as part of a job title mentioned at the bottom of the DoJ’s announcement:“A separate superseding indictment unsealed today in the Southern District of New York charges Tareck Zaidan El Aissami Maddah, 45, Venezuela’s vice president for the economy, Joselit Ramirez Camacho, 33, Venezuela’s superintendent of cryptocurrency (Sunacrip), and Samark Lopez Bello, 45, a Venezuelan businessman, with a series of crimes relating to efforts to evade sanctions imposed by OFAC against Maduro Moros, El Aissami Maddah, and Lopez Bello.”This crypto reference still likely does not mean direct crypto involvement. “Adding Ramirez now just means that the Petro is a part (but not the whole) of the equation,” Ayyar said. He also noted that Ramirez was indicted in 2019, but was added to this 2020 indictment, which now takes the place of last year’s accusations.“To me, this suggests that the petro was undoubtedly one means for sanctions evasion and money laundering, but not the only one,” Ayyar said, adding:“There was enough sanctions evasion and money laundering even without the Petro being involved. But no way do they add Ramirez to the indictment today unless the Petro/crypto was involved.”Although the charges state no direct specifics, Ayyar said he thinks the whole situation might have involved other crypto assets, aside from the Petro. “What other currencies did Venezuela accept in their token pre-sale?” he said. “I would think it had to include BTC and ETH, but I can't recall,” he posited. “Those currencies were likely used for sanctions evasion and money laundering, too.”Taking into account the wide range of laws, allegations and parties entangled in the situation, including Ramirez, Spencer sees the Petro being included in the inspections and proceedings. “I would go so far to say that the Petro will likely be involved, but most likely as a collateral issue and not the central focus of any trial.”Crypto may have been used, but not as part of these allegationsProviding even further clarity, Spencer explained the Venezeulan brass likely used crypto at some point, but not during the right time frame. He said:“It is highly likely that these government officials engaged in crypto transactions during the time that they are alleged to have committed acts of corruption and drug smuggling. But the indictment does not allege this. The indictment alleges bulk cash smuggling, shell corporations, and illegal travel. There are no allegations in the Indictments that any of the defendants actually used cryptocurrencies.”All this leads back to an initial sticking point proposed by Spencer — why did HSI’s Alysa Erichs mention crypto when the asset class was not directly involved? The most logical answer is that she mentioned it as part of the organization’s current overall endeavors.*Jeffrey Albus and Dylan Love contributed reporting to this article."

For weeks now, global equities markets have been swinging wildly due to the uncertainty. However, compared to the traditional markets, Bitcoin has been holding up quite well and its volatility has been gradually reducing in the past few days.Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead believes that the current crisis “is like no other” and it can “have a larger global economic impact than any downturn in recent memory.” However, Morehead believes that after the initial days of correlation with the general markets, cryptocurrencies will start to trade independently. He expects the institutional investors to gradually enter the space and make big allocations to crypto that can carry Bitcoin to a new high “in the next twelve months.”Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360Bitbank market analyst Yuya Hasegawa recently revealed in an official blog post that Bitcoin’s volume and account registrations on its crypto exchange platform spiked following Bitcoin’s crash on March 12. This showed that retail investors wanted to buy the dip, a phenomenon not seen in November and December of 2018, the final stages of the crushing bear market.Several major cryptocurrencies are attempting to form a bottom. If successful, we expect the buyers waiting on the sidelines to jump in, which is likely to pull the crypto markets higher. Let’s analyze the charts of the major cryptocurrencies and spot the critical levels that could suggest the start of a new uptrend.BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) has stayed above the breakout level of $6,435 for the past three days but the bulls have not been able to scale $7,000. This shows a lack of buyers at higher levels.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWe now expect the bears to attempt to sink the BTC/USD pair below the breakout level of $6,435. If successful, a drop to $5,660.65 is possible. If this level also cracks, the decline can extend to $5,000.On the other hand, if the pair bounces off the support at $6,435 and breaks above $7,000, it will resume the up move that can reach the 200-day SMA at $8,306 and above it $10,000. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the long position at $5,600.ETH/USDEther (ETH) continues to trade near the midpoint of the $117.090-$155.612 range. This tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long. We expect the biggest altcoin to either move up to the resistance of the range or dip to the support at $117.090.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls can carry the ETH/USD pair above the overhead resistance at $155.612, we anticipate the start of a new uptrend. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions as proposed in an earlier analysis.Contrary to our assumption, if the pair dips to $117.090, it will indicate that bears are back in the game. A break below $117.090 can drag the price to the next support at $100.XRP/USDXRP broke above the descending channel and closed (UTC time) above the horizontal resistance of $0.17468 on March 26. This triggered our buy suggested in an earlier analysis.XRP USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls can sustain the XRP/USD pair above $0.17468, we anticipate a move to $0.21608 and above it to the 200-day SMA at $0.24.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair reverses direction from the current levels and slides below the immediate support of $0.15708. Below this level, the pair can re-enter the channel and dip to $0.145. For now, the stops can be maintained at $0.143.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of the descending channel but is yet to scale and sustain above the 20-day EMA at $233. This shows that the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. If the altcoin turns down from the current levels, it can drop to $197.43. A break below this level will be a huge negative as it can drag the price to $166.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewOn the other hand, if the BCH/USD pair can climb above the 20-day EMA, a move to the 200-day SMA at $273 and above it to $350 is likely. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) has been trading close to the 20-day EMA for the past few days. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which points to a possible range-bound action.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the BSV/USD pair turns down from the current levels, it can drop to $146.96, which is an important support. If this support holds, the pair might consolidate between $146.96 and $185.87 for a few days. A break below $146.96 can drag the price to $120.Conversely, the pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $185.87. Above this level, the up move can reach $250. Therefore, the traders can hold their long positions with a stop loss of $146.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) has broken out of the descending channel but the bulls have not been able to scale the price above the 20-day EMA at $42.28. This indicates that the bears are defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.LTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the $35.8582 support, a drop to $30 is likely.On the other hand, if the bulls can drive the pair above the 20-day EMA, a new uptrend is likely. Above the 20-day EMA, the up move can reach the 200-day SMA at $55 and above it $63.8769. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.EOS/USDEOS has been trading close to the overhead resistance at $2.4001 for the past three days. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry.EOS USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls can propel the EOS/USD pair above $2.4001 and the 20-day EMA at $2.49, it could start a new uptrend. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions as recommended in our earlier analysis.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair reverses direction from the current levels and plummets below $2.0632.BNB/USDBinance Coin (BNB) has reached the 20-day EMA at $13.33, which is acting as a stiff resistance. If this level is crossed, the up move can reach the downtrend line where we anticipate the bears to mount a stiff resistance.BNB USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest that the selling pressure is reducing.Nevertheless, if the BNB/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink it below the horizontal support at $12.1111. Below this level, the next support to watch out for is $10.8427.We do not find any reliable setup with an attractive risk to reward ratio, hence, we remain neutral on the pair.XTZ/USDTezos (XTZ) continues to trade inside the bullish ascending triangle pattern. This setup will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $1.955. The pattern target of a breakout of the triangle is $2.9004 and above it $3.30.Therefore, traders can initiate long positions as suggested in our earlier analysis.XTZ USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewHowever, if the bulls fail to propel the XTZ/USD pair above $1.955, the bears will attempt to break it below the trendline of the triangle. If the price breaks and sustains below the trendline, it will invalidate the bullish setup.On a break below the trendline, the decline can extend to $1.4453 and if that level also fails to hold, the next level to watch out for is $1.3351.LEO/USDThe bulls are struggling to push UNUS SED LEO (LEO) above the overhead resistance of $1.04. This shows that the bears are defending this resistance level. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have maintained the price between $1-$1.03 for the past few days.Usually, such a consolidation near the resistance increases the likelihood of a breakout from it.LEO USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewA breakout of $1.04 will complete a bullish reversal pattern. Hence, the traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the resistance as suggested in our earlier analysis.Contrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the LEO/USD pair below the 20-day EMA at $0.998, a drop to the 50-day SMA at $0.956 is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

42065, Binance Academy Establishes Physical Presence in Shanghai ,2020-03-27t17:51:00+00:00,2294,64,"Binance Academy has entered into an agreement with Shanghai’s local government to set up an office in the country. The initiative will reportedly be devoted to research blockchain technology in accordance with an Oct. 24 statement from Xi Jinping promoting its use.As announced on March 27 by local news outlet TheBlockBeats and Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, Binance Academy will establish the Lingang Blockchain Technology and Industry Research Institute in Shanghai’s Lingang special economic zone.The initiative is the result of cooperation with local organizations in the Lingang area, and is set to promote China’s blockchain technology research and industrial application, as well as promoting talent training within China.The research institute was established in response to a push from the Chinese government to develop blockchain technology, with Helen Hai, head of the Binance Charity foundation and lead for the new institute, noting:“In establishing the Lingang Research Institute with our local partners, Binance Academy endeavors to build a leading think tank and research hub that contributes to large-scale developments in blockchain technology.”Don Tapscott, founder of the Blockchain Research Institute in Canada, will be the honorary dean of the Lingang Research Institute.Is this a Binance office?In November, a rumor circulated that Binance’s office in Shanghai was raided by police. As reported by Cointelegraph, Binance denied both the raids and even the existence of the offices. Officially, the company is incorporated in Malta and has several branches around the world.However, a statement from Maltese regulators in February claims that Binance was never regulated in the country. Local Maltese reporters claimed that its legal headquarters are in the Cayman Islands.Nevertheless, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao often reiterates that Binance is a “decentralized organization” working from many locations across the world through heavy use of remote work.In an interview with Cointelegraph, he also said that he likes to “keep mobile” and being “able to live in a different city every month” — though he did not explicitly confirm that he regularly succeeds in doing so.Binance’s Lingang Research Institute is thus more likely to be similar to local branches such as Binance Singapore or Binance Jersey. It is not an exchange, and is unlikely to be the center of any business activity for the company.Even though China supports blockchain, it is still a harsh critic of cryptocurrencies — and it has banned crypto exchanges since 2017."
42063, Blockchain Tech Leads the Charge in UAE’s Coronavirus Fight ,2020-03-27t17:10:00+00:00,2475,97,"A number of international blockchain-based solutions have taken up the challenge of preventing further outbreaks in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the most recent country to propose solutions reliant on a distributed database.As reported by the Emirates News Agency on March 25, the UAE’s Ministry of Community Development (MOCD) has begun using digital channels to provide government services.MOCD’s “stay-at-home” priorityThe MOCD would be relying on the use of digital identity through blockchain-based systems and chat systems for the digital authentication of official certificates and other documents. This removes the need for users to leave their homes.So far, according to local media, the implemented blockchain system is capable of processing 2,919 types of documents, which would allow the ministry to regulate the flow of customers.On this measure, Hessa Essa Buhumaid, UAE’s Minister of Community Development, said the following:“This step confirms the ministry’s commitment to ensure the continuity and flexibility of all government services in light of the directives of the smart government to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”These services are being offered through the ministry and smart application’s official website.Blockchain as a solution in other countries amid the crisisIn other countries, companies have begun incorporating blockchains into their coronavirus solutions as well.Alipay, along with the Zhejiang Provincial Health Commision and the Economy and Information Technology Department, launched a blockchain-based platform that enables users to trace the demand and the supply chains of medical supplies in the midst of the pandemic crisis.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published on March 19 some guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic, listing blockchain-based managers in food and agricultural distribution. The DHS stressed that such list aims to help local government to mantain services active across the country, amid the COVID-19 crisis that triggered shutdowns in eight states.Cointelegraph also reported on March 14 that the Italian Red Cross and the Colli Albani Committee were raising donations using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This was accomplished with the help of blockchain startup, Helperbit. The money raised is now being used to build pre-triage medical posts."
42060," After 14 Years in Investment Banking, I Joined the Crypto Industry ",2020-03-27t15:49:00+00:00,5699,105,"“How could I possibly do this?” — That is what I asked myself when the opportunity presented itself to leave my 14-year career in corporate and investment banking to join the startup world. It was certainly one of the biggest decisions of my life. I chewed on it for a month, which in my world of decision making, is quite a long time.One of my most active clients at the time was a TSX-listed DirectCash Payments Inc, a global payment processing company with operations on multiple continents and valued at $460 million when sold to Cardtronics in early 2017. As one of their lead investment bankers, I worked extensively with the management team over the years. We traveled the world doing different acquisitions in order to fuel growth and to raise money for those acquisitions.When the business was sold, the largest shareholder wanted to start a new company to address concerns that he had with respect to cryptocurrency — primarily around security and reliability. We thought that we could, based on our knowledge of the movement of money, do this better than a lot of the other players in the industry. He asked me to join and start the company with him.I thought it was a crazy idea. It involved moving cities, moving industries and leaving a career that I spent 14 years building. But, I took a month to think about it over the holidays in 2017. Markets were frothy, but I believed in the industry; more importantly, I believed in our abilities as a team. I had the opportunity to build something completely from scratch while working in a new and emerging industry with a team I knew could get the job done.I started asking myself: “How could I possibly not?”It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Once I made the leap, everything about blockchain surprised me. But, at the same time, nothing surprised me. I came with zero expectations as to what it would be like. I had never done anything like this before, and I am not sure anything can surprise you if you’ve never done it before.I was brand new to the startup world. I’d always worked for a large institution. I learned there’s nothing more challenging in the business world than a startup. Every day, you come to work, and you're faced with what sometimes seems to be insurmountable problems that you find a way to surmount. In the blockchain industry, nothing has been done before, so you're constantly trying to figure it out for the first time.The bad actors are currently the biggest challenge. We must stay ahead of them. Everyone in crypto faces this challenge every day. Hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, so we need to be increasingly sophisticated in order to stay ahead of them. It’s disappointing that you have that negative aspect of a new emerging industry that has so many positive benefits to it.Would I make the leap into the startup world again?It's obviously a massive decision, but one that I certainly don't regret — one that I'd recommend to anyone to do… at least once.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Pamela Draper is the president and CEO of Bitvo Inc., a cryptocurrency exchange launched in Canada in 2018.

42059, Microsoft Files Patent For Crypto Mining System Using Body Activity Data ,2020-03-27t15:44:00+00:00,8990,155,"Tech giant, Microsoft, is looking to develop a cryptocurrency system which enables individuals to mine cryptocurrency using their body activity data, eliminating the need for specialized mining machines.Microsoft published a patent dubbed “Cryptocurrency system using body activity data” on March 26. Their paperwork details a method of crypto mining which exploits data associated with a user’s body activity to exercise a new form of proof-of-work. The document further details:“For example, a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.”Diagram of the invention. Source: PatentscopeTo implement the process, a server provides a task to a user’s device, which is communicatively coupled to the server. A special sensor then indicates body activity of the individual, while a cryptocurrency system verifies whether or not the body activity data satisfies the conditions set by the cryptocurrency system. Ultimately, the system awards cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.Blockchain patents gain tractionTechnology companies continue to experiment with cryptocurrency and blockchain in an attempt to remain a step ahead of their rivals. In the United States alone, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted 227 blockchain-related patents from January 2014 to October 2019.Recently, another tech behemoth, IBM, was awarded a patent for the development of a so-called “self-aware token.” The idea of the development is that the adoption of new forms of currency will create questions regarding the ability to validate, authenticate, and coordinate transactions across diverse forms of payment and trade that traditionally had little or no interaction.Brian Amstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, patented a method that enables users to make Bitcoin (BTC) payments using email addresses tied to wallet addresses, without incurring transaction fees."

They were also charged with making material misrepresentations and omissions, as Centra Tech made false claims about partnerships with major companies, including Visa, to dupe investors.In November, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also charged former pro boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled for unlawfully promoting the ICO and failing to disclose the payments of $100,000 and $50,000 that they received from Centra Tech respectively.The government is expected to present at least one dozen witnesses alongside text messages and custodial evidence in its bid to convict the pair."
42057, Excitement for Exchange as USDT Linear Perpetual Contracts Launch ,2020-03-27t15:07:00+00:00,3016,2,"A cryptocurrency derivatives exchange has announced it is launching USDT linear perpetual contracts, alongside a plethora of features.During an “ask me anything” session, Bybit revealed that hedging will be a core offering for its new USDT perpetual contract — allowing traders to hold long and short positions in USDT simultaneously.Traders will also have the freedom to assign different levels of leverage for their long and short positions — switching between cross and isolated margins with ease. Bybit says it is capitalizing on the growing trend for option products, all while delivering a straightforward solution that eliminates unnecessary complexities for retail traders.During the live broadcast, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou noted the USDT linear perpetual contracts are going to launch on March 25.What else is in storeOther plans recently unveiled by Bybit include the launch of contract insurance for BTC/USD perpetual contracts. This offering will be launched in the second quarter of this year.Zhou described this as “liquidation insurance” — and cited increasing demand for a broader range of new options products. This means traders will have protection should the market go against their positions. Once a set fee and a premium have been paid, insurance is provided in the event long or short positions suffer price declines — prompting a rise in Bitcoin’s value.Trading is increasingly moving from PC to mobile, but Bybit argues that many of the apps that exist in the marketplace today are designed for simple transactions, leaving users who are constantly on the move unable to execute advanced strategies at will. To this end, enhancements are going to be rolled out for Bybit’s mobile app — including strategy alerts and a new order system.Bybit is available hereUpon launch, traders are going to be able to set a range of indicators at will, including Fibonacci retracement, using Bybit’s specially designed price chart. They will then receive notifications directly to their device whenever the indicator is triggered by a price movement.What the AMA revealedThe ask me anything broadcast was held on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel.Zhou dedicated time to discussing the all-new user interface and user experience that Bybit has developed in recent months — a fresh design that’s already live on the exchange’s website.The CEO said that many existing users loved using dark mode. As a result, enhancements have been made to make it “smoother, more refreshing and more reasonable.”He added: “My designer team spent hours looking at a dark mode and trying to design the color contrasting and the layout to help traders focus on the price movement on the chart.”Zhou also revealed that, since Bybit launched in December 2018, more than 333,500 users have registered on the platform — with 15,000 people using it on a daily basis. Current daily trading volume stands at $1,125,822,785. The vast majority of its users — 68.6%, to be exact — are based in Europe, with 23.3% in Asia.The CEO added that Bybit firmly believes the client should always come first — and this is a continual focus when new products are being developed. The company is also focusing on creating retail-friendly products that are appealing to individuals rather than sharks or institutions.“Bybit is a dedicated derivatives exchange, and we would like to focus on that,” Zhou added. “Most of our team’s background is in traditional finance.”Zhou also noted that his platform is product-driven — and the company has a keen awareness that it will attract greater numbers of traders if it develops good products.Learn more about BybitDisclaimer.

It also specifies virtual asset consignment, settlement and transactions with fiat currency.The range of industry areas covered has led to speculation that KB Kookmin Bank is launching a subsidiary brand to offer financial services and products that receive and manage virtual assets in investment funds.The Digital Assets Custody moniker provides a thread linking all of these services.

42054," Singapore Grants Crypto License Exemptions to Ripple, Coinbase and Binance ",2020-03-27t13:10:00+00:00,6538,140,"While Singapore recently adopted specific cryptocurrency legislation — the Payment Services Act (PSA) — in January 2020, it turns out that some crypto firms like Ripple, Coinbase and Binance have been exempt from the law since the beginning of the year.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank and major financial regulatory authority, exempted a number of major payment services from holding a financial license under the PSA.According to a statement released on March 24, the listed companies are allowed to continue to provide specific payment services without holding a PSA license for a limited period of time.Ripple, Coinbase and Binance were granted six months of exemptionAs such, local subsidiaries of major crypto companies like Ripple, Coinbase and Binance are officially authorized to provide digital payment token service in Singapore starting from January 2020. According to the MAS, Ripple Labs Singapore, Coinbase Singapore and Binance Asia Services can provide services without a PSA license until July 28, 2020.The MAS noted that the exemption will cease after the specified period or if the entity submits a licence application under the PSA.BitGo and Gemini are also on the listSome crypto companies were granted a longer exemption period. BitGo Singapore, a local subsidiary of one of the world's biggest Bitcoin (BTC) payment processors, and Gemini Trust Company, a crypto exchange and custody service led by the Winklevoss twins, were given a 12-month exemption.According to the MAS notice, the companies are allowed to provide account issuance services, domestic money transfer services, and inward cross-border money transfer services until Jan. 28, 2021.Other crypto companies in the list include cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, decentralized offline cryptocurrency sales network Pundi X and Cumberland, a cryptocurrency trading unit of DRW Holdings.As reported by Cointelegraph, a number of local crypto businesses in Singapore have praised the PSA as a legal instrument that will attract crypto and blockchain-related business, not chase them away."
42052," Bitcoin Was Heading for a Big Upsurge, Traders Explain What Changed ",2020-03-27t12:52:00+00:00,32739,171,"With the firm recovery of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Bitcoin defending the $6,400 support level with strength, crypto traders anticipated the Bitcoin price to rebound to at least the mid-$7,500 area in the short term. In the past 48 hours, however, they have started to lean toward a resumption of a bearish trend for Bitcoin, as the relief rally of the dominant cryptocurrency is seemingly coming to an end.Much data from the imbalanced buy and sell orders on major exchanges like BitMEX and the decline in the total open interest of Bitcoin futures point toward lacking demand from buyers. Historically, when the Bitcoin price came close to a full-blown capitulation phase as seen in December 2018, it required months of accumulation in a low price range to recover over a lengthy period of time.The last time Bitcoin dropped to the low-$3,000s region, it took around four months to begin a gradual recovery to the $7,000 to $8,000 area. There are concerns that Bitcoin’s price may have recovered a little too quickly after dropping to $3,700, and as the biggest whales in the crypto market like Joe007 explain, such a short-term, V-shape recovery after a massive correction never occurred in the crypto market in the past.Top trader explains why Wall Street’s pain is translating to a painful Bitcoin correctionSpeaking to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Eric Thies said that the struggle of Wall Street and institutional investors directly affected the price trend of Bitcoin. As the stock market in the United States took a hit, the open interest across major futures exchanges including CME dropped off substantially. In futures trading, the term “open interest” refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open at a certain time.According to data from Skew, aggregated open interest for all Bitcoin futures contracts — which include CME, BitMEX, Binance, OKEx and Huobi — fell from more than $4.2 billion to just $2 billion since March 1.Based on the data, Thies emphasized that the drop in the volume of the futures market led the price of Bitcoin to correct, causing mayhem in the entire cryptocurrency market:“With last week's plummet, many were initially left scratching their heads. But it makes complete sense from a logical point of view. Looking at the facts of the situation: Bitcoin was looking bullish prior to the breakdown; this is Bitcoin's first 'recession.' [...] Point being, that since futures carry such a heavy weight of the volume in the market, guess what's going to happen when wall street is getting destroyed… Bitcoin also gets shredded. And last week was a very interesting point to be made.”Some strategists in the U.S. seem to believe that the stock market has not reached its bottom yet. The coronavirus pandemic is still expanding, and the U.S. overtook China as the most infected country in the world. The negative impact the Bitcoin futures market is having on the price trend of BTC is unlikely to subside anytime soon, adding to the selling pressure on the market as a result.Why Bitcoin was initially en route for a relief rally and is now at risk of another correctionSeveral renowned traders who have predicted multiple market cycles throughout the history of Bitcoin such as PentarhUdi foresaw the Bitcoin price drop to sub-$6,000 coming when the price of BTC was still hovering above $10,000 in February.The 200-week moving average mentioned by PentarhUdi on Feb. 10 was $5,800. However, a cascade of liquidations on BitMEX and other exchanges led Bitcoin’s price to free fall to $3,600.Following the correction, PentarhUdi noted that Bitcoin could recover to up to $8,500, which technically presents a 200-day simple moving average. Then, the trader said that BTC remains vulnerable to a second correction to sub-$3,000s, adding:“Amid global financial panic, Bitcoin price aggressively attacks Weekly SMA200 and bottom triangle line of previous chart. I see this might not end as well as I thought. As the bearish potential of global markets is huge.”From $5,200, Bitcoin saw a decent recovery to around $6,900 but was rejected at a historically strong resistance level. It is now at a borderline negative year-over-year, and in the short term, Thies told Cointelegraph that he now leans toward a bearish outlook:“One additional interesting point from the event is that it was on 3/13/20 and the low was $3,850. Looking at the charts, the closing price of 3/13/19 was the exact same number. From the pricing standpoint, it is interesting that BTC is now borderline negative for YOY gains since the implementation of futures went live in 2017. I'm watching carefully here since I'm actually leaning unfortunately bearish at the moment.”The bottom of bitcoin could be lowerBitcoin has shown less correlation with the U.S. stock market since March 25. While the Dow Jones surged by more than 6% on Thursday, the price of Bitcoin remained relatively stable. Venture capital investor and partner at Placeholder Chris Burniske said that, purely based on technicals, Bitcoin could retest the lows at $3,000.That validates the historical cycles of Bitcoin, which show that Bitcoin has never recovered in a V-shape pattern from a near 60% correction within a three-week span. For Bitcoin to maintain a bullish trend at a macro level over the medium to long term, a retest of lows and a stable accumulation phase lasting several months is critical.Echoing the logic of other experienced traders, Burniske said that the plunge of Bitcoin through the 200-week moving average, which typically served as a historical support level for BTC, leaves the dominant cryptocurrency vulnerable to another big pullback:“Lots of people are asking where BTC bottoms. The short of it is I wouldn’t be surprised to see a retest of our 2018 lows near $3,000. Historically, I’ve relied on the 200 week moving average (yellow line below) as our bear market bottom, but we fell through that at ~$5,500 last Thursday.”The unprecedented weakness in the altcoin market can be considered another signal of the lacking appetite for high-risk assets and cryptocurrencies in general, as trader DonAlt said: “BTC looks like it could go up, down or sideways. Alts look like they could go down, down or down.”When Bitcoin is on track for an actual relief rally, altcoins tend to front-run Bitcoin, as seen in December 2019 when Bitcoin started to recover from $6,400 to over $7,500. Bitcoin is now essentially in the same price range; it has rebounded from $6,400 and rose to as high as $6,950, but major altcoins the likes of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have barely moved against both Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar.Strategists predict the U.S. stock market continuing to be rattled by the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. New reports show that the virus outbreak in the U.S. may just be starting — and like China in the early days, there is a high probability that the U.S. may take more than two months to recover.Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson explained that the recovery of the U.S. from the coronavirus could be delayed by a week or two compared to China, based on the contrast in containment efforts.With record-high jobless claims and the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak, both the U.S. stock market and Bitcoin — primarily due to the declining futures market open interest and volume — remain highly vulnerable to another leg down in the foreseeable future."
42051, US County Extends Regs for Crypto Miners Requiring Them to Use Clean Energy ,2020-03-27t12:47:00+00:00,679,10,"The Missoula County Board of Commissioners in Montana, United States, has extended its green regulations for cryptocurrency miners, which are designed to control the energy consumption of the industry in the county.The regulations, which require crypto miners to set up their operations only in light industrial and heavy industrial districts, and only after they have been reviewed and approved as a conditional use, are now extended until April 3, 2021.County authorities initially adopted the rules a year ago, with a view “to protect the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of county residents.”For the sake of the planetThe regulations are part of a city-county resolution aimed at transitioning to 100% usage of clean energy by 2030. As such, the county board is considering proposing it as permanent zoning, local news outlet The Missoulian reported on March 27.The board has not made changes to the rules, which means that miners will still need to exclusively use renewable energy, as well as ensure that all electronic waste generated will be handled by a relevant recycling firm.Authorities approved the extensions after a public hearing during a commissioners meeting, where only one citizen spoke out and compared crypto mining operations to the coronavirus outbreak, saying:""Just as coronavirus, it's a prolonged consequence where if we don't act immediately to lower our demand for electricity and introduce renewable electricity, our planet is going to be degraded tragically in the future. It is an emergency. It's just not one that we can perceive on an hour-to-hour basis like the virus.""The regulations, however, will not apply to crypto mining facilities existing before April 4, 2019.Eco-friendly developments in crypto miningSome crypto industry players have already developed eco-friendly crypto mining solutions, with German Bitcoin (BTC) mining infrastructure firm Northern Bitcoin AG completing tests for its new air-cooled mining container last year. The firm operates mining hardware that uses renewable energy sources and aims to attain optimal efficiency and sustainability.In January, researchers at Ireland’s Economic and Social Research Institute proposed that using a blockchain-based “forward trading system” can provide a more effective incentive for the smart management of renewable energy consumption. The proposed mechanism includes the use of smart contracts to automate energy control, trading and management within a distributed framework."
42050, Bitcoin Scams Continue to Exploit Covid-19 Chaos in UK ,2020-03-27t12:17:00+00:00,3124,95,"Following a warning from the national watchdog earlier this month, regional authorities across the United Kingdom say Bitcoin scammers are using the coronavirus crisis to hoax citizens.In a series of consumer fraud alerts published throughout March, Manchester city council and the counties of Pembrokeshire and Norfolk echoed the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)’s caution against “sophisticated” and “opportunistic” cryptocurrency-related schemes operating during the pandemic.MisrepresentationsThe three regional authorities identify a range of tactics adopted by Bitcoin (BTC) scams to take advantage of the social disorientation and anxiety amid the public health crisis. Manchester city council warns against:“Fraudsters purporting to be from a research group that mimic the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO). They claim to provide the victim with a list of active infections in their area but to access this information the victim needs to either: click on a link which redirects them to a credential-stealing page; or make a donation of support in the form of a payment into a Bitcoin account.”Similar schemes claiming to offer up-to-date infection tracking data and soliciting payments in Bitcoin are identified on all three regional government sites.Meanwhile, the FCA has emphasized that high-return investment opportunities, including investments in crypto assets, may be repurposed to take advantage of the current pandemic.Pandemic opportunismAs previously reported, crypto-related scams have been operating on both sides of the Atlantic during the COVID-19 outbreak.In mid-March, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission highlighted that fraudsters may be exploiting the crisis in order to add credibility to their scam schemes or manipulate emotions.Misrepresentations of the WHO and fraudulent appeals for donations in cryptocurrency — as well as new ransomware called “CovidLock” — have also been identified by cybersecurity researchers."
42049, China and UK’s Planned Digital Currencies Appear to Have Little in Common ,2020-03-27t12:13:00+00:00,2698,91,"As major central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects develop apace, it is becoming clear that not all digital coins will look, or even function the same way.A recent analysis by Chinese financial media group InterChain Pulse reveals that two of the most visible such projects — those of the Bank of England (BoE) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) — may be more different than they are alike.InterChain Pulse cited BoE’s discussion paper released earlier this month, where the financial institution seriously weighed the pros and cons of issuing a CBDC denominated in pounds sterling.InterChain compared the provisions set forth in the bank’s report with those of the PBoC and concluded that the two have significant differences in their design.Unlike China, where the central bank will be the issuing authority of the CBDC, Great Britain has assigned the issuance of its CBDC to the parliament. Moreover, China is working on the digitization of its national currency, the yuan, while Great Britain is planning to create a competitive payment system.Compared with the digital currency of the PBoC, another significant difference is the application of smart contracts to ensure transactions. The Chinese central bank’s digital currency currently does not support this type of operation.The BoE’s CBDC will comply with anti-money laundering (AML) provisions, the financing of terrorism and sanctions procedures, and be compatible with the General Data Protection Legislation.The PBoC’s CBDC must comply with the AML provisions and the bank’s own privacy rules.InterChain Pulse noted some similarities between the two projects, the most notable being that neither will be based on distributed ledger technology. As both will be used for transactions, BoE and PBoC are developing networks that concentrate on supporting a very high transaction frequency.Additionally, InterChain Pulse states that neither network will recognize a private digital currency.Recent patents shed light on China’s digital yuanAs Cointelegraph recently reported, patents from Chinese payments platform Alipay — which is working on the CBDC project — have revealed some details about the digital yuan’s features.Among them, Alipay itself will be a secondary issuer of the currency, while wallet functionality can be determined by behavior and personal data."
42043, Gaming Giant Atari to Feature in The Sandbox’s Forthcoming Blockchain Platform ,2020-03-27t10:06:00+00:00,2648,133,"Iconic entertainment firm Atari is partnering with The Sandbox (TSB) on the upcoming voxel-based blockchain version of its popular user-generated content and gaming platform.In an announcement on March 27, blockchain startup Animoca Brands — parent company of TSB Gaming — revealed that the collaboration will involve creating 3D voxel versions of popular Atari game properties. These include Asteroids, Centipede, Pong and RollerCoaster Tycoon.Scarce gaming real estateIn its blockchain iteration, based on Ethereum, The Sandbox will offer users three new features shaped by the technology: a tool for building non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and in-game voxel assets, a marketplace for trading these assets, and a game maker tool for users to construct, share and monetize interactive games.Under the terms of the collaboration, Atari will receive large digital “estates” within The Sandbox gaming metaverse. These estates are scarce, digital spaces where gamers will have access to 3D voxelized versions of classic Atari games.Estates can be assembled from groupings of LAND tokens, which can also be purchased by users to serve as locations for constructing and launching independent gaming content.166,464 LANDs in total will be made available in The Sandbox, and feature alongside in-game virtual assets and native SAND tokens.As part of The Sandbox, a theme park-like metaverse will also include a number of Atari game titles, alongside Atari-themed virtual attractions, buildings, and other objects. Users will be able to engage socially with Avatar characters and play collectively in immersive gaming experiences.Collaborations and investmentsAs Cointelegraph has reported, the collaboration between Atari — developer of classic video games such as Tetris and Pac Man — and Animoca Brands has been long-standing.Earlier this month, The Sandbox announced a host of big-name backers — Square Enix, B Cryptos, Mindfulness Capital, and True Global Ventures — for the upcoming third presale of the game’s virtual spaces (LANDs), scheduled for March 31.To date, The Sandbox has had over 40 million downloads and brought in over 1,300 Ether (ETH) with the first and second of its LAND presales."

42041, Another Class Action Suit Brought Against Robinhood Over Platform Outages ,2020-03-27t09:35:00+00:00,3027,88,"Following a series of platform outages during historic price action earlier this month, Robinhood, a popular stock and cryptocurrency trading app, now faces another class action complaint.The lawsuit, filed March 25, was brought by customer Bruce Queen, on behalf of “all Robinhood customers within the United States who were not able to execute trades on securities or change limit orders during the Outages and incurred financial losses.”Missing the biggest gain in Dow historyAs Cointelegraph reported, on March 2, the Robinhood suffered technical problems for the entire day, meaning customers were unable to trade the securities in their accounts for a period of over sixteen hours.This coincided with the then-biggest one-day point gain in the Dow Jones stock market index history.Queen alleges that he had bought put contracts through the platform on Feb. 28, and submitted a sell order for these on March 2. However, he was unable to access the sell order throughout the day and the order was canceled by Robinhood on the morning of March 3. Queen was then forced to sell his contracts at a lower price on March 3.Technical trouble not over for RobinhoodWhile Queen managed to sell his contracts on March 3, Robinhood’s technical problems were far from over. The platform went offline again for around three hours that day, reportedly due to an unprecedented load caused by a record volume of trades.A week later on March 9 the platform suffered another outage, with customers unable to buy or sell securities on the public market. This third outage coincided with a major crash across stock markets, with the Dow losing 2,000 points and the Nasdaq Composite index falling 7.3%.Yet more issues with the platform were reported on March 12.Queen is not claiming losses on behalf of himself during these subsequent outages, but they are included on behalf of class-action participants who have.Trying to win back community trustFollowing the repeated outages there was a heated reaction from service users who had lost out. The platform has attempted to win back the trust of affected users in the form of credits, with the exact dollar amount being decided on a case-to-case basis.However, it seems that this has failed to pacify all of the disgruntled customers, who are now demanding a jury trial in the class-action suit.Indeed, Robinhood is facing another class-action lawsuit related to the platform outages in a United States federal court in Florida."
42039, Getting Ready for the Altcoin Resurgence ,2020-03-27t08:59:00+00:00,7213,125,"The altcoin market has been through tough times. At one point, the market lost over 90% of its value from its peak of $780 billion in January 2018. Many altcoin projects that were supposed to be “the next big thing” are nowhere to be seen today.We are experiencing first-hand the beginning of “Crypto Darwinism” in the altcoin marketWe see Darwinism in nature, where natural selection means only the fittest survive. We also see these same principles in capitalism — the automobile replaced the horse and carriage, email replaced fax, and online streaming replaced DVDs.Now, we’re beginning to see a Darwinian selection process in the altcoin market. Altcoin projects unfit to survive have been either eradicated or abandoned, whereas projects that are committed to delivering value to their users have generally made it through the crypto winter and are beginning to flourish. Projects such as Chainlink and Cosmos have even claimed spots among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. We’re beginning to see the resurgence of altcoins.Related: What’s Next for the Industry as ‘Crypto Winter’ Thaws?A new generation of altcoins are beginning to make waves, and these projects seem to have a number of traits in common.1) TractionMost of the altcoins that are considered top contenders today have proven use cases with proven users. Projects such as Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRON) and EOS (EOS) are still in the top 20 today because they provide a robust ecosystem for decentralized apps with smart contract functionality. A quick look at the top DApps shows that these three platforms are home to the DApps with the most users and DApp usage. They host applications such as games, gambling platforms and decentralized exchanges, providing users with real value and entertainment. Games such as EOS Dynasty and My Crypto Heroes have thousands of active users per day. 888Tron, the gambling platform on Tron’s blockchain, has $800,000 in daily gambling volume. Exchanges such as Eosfinex and NewDex provide users with an ultra-secure, high-liquidity, non-custodial trading solution.Related: Why Centralized Exchanges Are DecentralizingChainlink provides value by increasing the utility of the systems connected to its decentralized pricing Oracle, removing reliance on centralized price feeds and thus reducing risk. Chainlink’s Oracles collect real-world price data and then provide this data so that dependent systems are not exposed to a centralized point of failure (in most cases, decentralized smart contract networks that rely on centralized price feeds are not really decentralized). Chainlink’s collaboration with both Ampleforth and Polkadot are great examples of altcoin use cases being validated and value being created.Another factor to consider in determining the success of altcoins2) Yielding assetsStaking is like a turbocharger for altcoins. Providing a yield, reducing supply and incentivizing participation are all very powerful. Altcoins like Cosmos (ATOM), Tezos and Icon (ICX) give users the opportunity to earn a passive income just by owning and staking their coins. Some government bonds, such as German 10-year bonds, are paying negative interest rates (you are paying to lend these institutions your money). Through staking altcoins, users can earn upwards of 10% in annual interest while simultaneously investing in projects they wish to support.Like installing a turbocharger on a broken engine, staking is not enough to turn a bad project into a good one, but it can certainly boost an altcoin network.The final element to an altcoin’s success3) CommunityCommunity is an element that can’t be overlooked for any project looking to succeed. The community involves everyone from users, developers, partners and marketers. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum are prime examples of the importance of community (if you’re reading this, you’re probably a member of either or both of those communities). Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced difficult moments, most notably the bear market of the last two years, and neither would have come through those challenges without their passionate communities.New networks will always face challenges, and it is the communities that will support the networks during tough times when they need it the most.A new kind of altcoin marketThis new dynamic in the altcoin market, where the fittest survive, can only be a good thing. It means the market is maturing and networks delivering value will be the ones that flourish, meaning the entire ecosystem is incentivized to get behind those networks.It looks like we could be at the start of a new kind of altcoin market, a market that rewards quality. It’s survival of the fittest in the altcoin space — and for those that survive, the future is bright.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Henry Child is the head of token sales at Bitfinex.

42038, Lawsuit Accuses Ripple CEO of Touting XRP While Silently Liquidating Holdings ,2020-03-27t08:54:00+00:00,17971,185,"There is new movement in a class-action lawsuit originally filed in May 2018, centered around allegations that Ripple violated the Securities Act through a 2013 initial coin offering (ICO) of the XRP token.On March 25, an amended complaint accuses Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse of touting the token to prospective investors while silently liquidating his holdings.Garlinghouse accused of liquidating 67 million XRP in 2017The amended complaint also emphasizes that Garlinghouse represented himself as “very, very, very long” and “on the HODL side” with regard to XRP during 2017, suggesting that the Ripple CEO was holding his XRP for the long-term.Despite his online posts, the plaintiffs allege that Garlinghouse sold 67 million XRP during 2017, adding that he was liquidating all of the tokens that he received from Ripple within days of receipt.The suit also asserts that “all 100 billion of the XRP in existence were created out of thin air by Ripple at its inception in 2013, before any distribution and without functionality except as a speculative investment,"" adding:“The value of XRP owned by Defendants substantially exceeds the value of Ripple’s revenue or cashflow from all other sources. Ripple’s dominant value proposition are the XRP tokens it owns and sells. Ripple’s value proposition as a company depends upon the promotion of XRP, yet XRP is entirely or essentially pre-functional and purchased by investors in anticipation of profit based on the efforts of Ripple.”Ripple accused of misrepresenting XRP’s utility to dodge securities lawsThe plaintiffs also added emphasis to claims that Ripple and Garlinghouse misrepresented XRP as having the utility of comprising a “bridge currency” so that the token could evade being classified as a security.“Defendants’ claims that XRP has a utilitarian purpose are false,” the plaintiffs state, adding:“These claims are misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to investors because the utility of XRP (or lack thereof) is pertinent to the value of XRP. Simply stated, these false claims about XRP's utility are nothing but an attempt to avoid the application of securities laws and drive demand for XRP.”Judge requested amended suitWhile Ripple sought the dismissal of the suit in September, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton allowed it to move forward in February.However, the judge requested that the plaintiffs explain the basis for their claims that Ripple made fraudulent claims concerning greater detail, citing several examples of the plaintiffs’ claims that were too general in scope. The aforementioned March 25 filing apparently represents a revision of the plaintiffs’ claims."
42036," Canada’s Tax Authority Demands Personal Data on 115,000 QuadrigaCX Users ",2020-03-27t07:07:00+00:00,3264,85,"EY, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, has been asked to submit all of the exchange’s user information to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).Court documents filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on March 24 detail the demand, which spans 750,000 documents on the exchange’s 115,000 customers.Canadian tax authority requests trove of QuadrigaCX user data“The Trustee has advised CRA that its intention is to simply produce a copy of the full EDiscovery Database, redacted only for the privilege, in response to the CRA Production Demand,” the document states.The requested data was collected by EY from both internal and third-party sources — spanning personal user information, account balances, and transaction histories from 2016 until 2018.In a letter published March 25, Miller Thomson, the court-appointed firm representing Quadriga’s users, states that it chose to comply with the CRA request after considering the expense and delays that disputing the request would incur upon the bankruptcy proceedings.“The official committee’s primary objective is to move the bankruptcy process towards a distribution expeditiously,” the letter states.Creditor’s committee expresses privacy concernsHowever, representatives of the creditor’s committee — a select group of former users representing the exchange’s customer base in talks with Miller Thomson — emphasized the privacy concerns of honoring the CRA request.Miller Thomson notes that there were “significant divergent views among the members of the Official Committee on the nature of the privacy interests.”Committee member Magdalena Grownowska tweeted that the demand is “an unprecedented affront to individual privacy,” expressing skepticism that the data is being collected by the CRA to calculate Quadriga’s tax liabilities — which EY had previously asserted would be “near impossible” to discern.The collapse of QuadrigaCXAfter launching in 2013, QuadrigaCX quickly gained traction and became one of the leading crypto exchanges in Canada.In 2018, the exchange began to experience increasing problems, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce freezing 28 million Canadian dollars (CAD) held across five accounts belonging to Quadriga subsidiary and payment processor Costodian Inc. The exchange would also partner with the shadow banking firm Crypto Capital.In subsequent proceedings, the Ontario Superior Court found that it was unable to determine if the funds belonged to Costodian, QuadrigaCX, or Quadriga’s customers. User complaints of delayed withdrawal requests would mount during 2018 — which the exchange blamed on poor liquidity resulting from the frozen funds.On Jan. 15, 2019, QuadrigaCX announced that its founder and CEO Gerry Cotten had died while traveling in India from medical complications associated with a pre-existing condition. With all of the exchange’s funds purportedly held in cold storage — for which only Cotten knew the password — the founder’s passing resulted in the loss of Quadriga’s CAD 190 million in user funds becoming inaccessible."

This is like no other. This will certainly end the longest global expansion on record. It is likely to have a larger global economic impact than any downturn in recent memory.”Bitcoin will recover in stagesMorehead noted that Bitcoin has been correlated with the sharemarket in this and other market downturns. However, he said the cryptocurrency tended to be less correlated after the first month or two of stock market price falls.“We now believe that the short-term high correlation with general markets is over and that crypto will trade independently.”He likened Bitcoin to bonds, which tend to shine in times of market turmoil, and predicted BTC will recover in stages before reaching a new all-time high:“The price of Bitcoin may set a new record in the next twelve months. It’s not going to happen overnight. My best guess is that it will take institutional investors 2-3 months to triage their current portfolio issues. Another 3-6 months to research new opportunities like distressed debt, special situations, crypto, etc. Then, as they begin making allocations, those markets will really begin to rise.”The Pantera Capital founder did not predict a price, however he has previously said that BTC has the potential to reach $356,000 within a couple years.Investors look to Pantera during a volatile marketAs the first Bitcoin fund in the United States, Pantera was quick to see the potential in cryptocurrency and raised $13 million for its debut offering in 2013, and $25 million for its second.While the CEO admits nothing is certain, he believes dark times see a flight of capital to quality, and that Bitcoin is well placed to benefit as the market leader for 11 years.“Bitcoin was born in a financial crisis. It will come of age in this one.”"
42029, Blockchain Set to Stamp Out Cheating in World Chess Competition ,2020-03-27t03:46:00+00:00,3796,136,"The 2020 Chess Candidates Tournament in Ekaterinburg, Russia has been postponed due to the coronavirus, but organizers are already looking to the future and how blockchain can give the sport a boost.The tournament pitted eight grandmasters against each other for the right to take on world champion Magnus Carlsen, but had to be halted after seven rounds when news emerged Russia was about to suspend international flights indefinitely.World Chess told Cointelegraph it was examining moving matches online and introducing blockchain technology.Opportunity for chessIlya Merenzon, CEO of World Chess, the company that organized the last world championship match and the official commercial partner of the International Chess Federation (FIDE), told Cointelegraph that chess was unusually well placed to thrive during the pandemic:“Unlike other sports, chess can be played with equal excitement offline and online. That is something that sets it apart from all the other major sports. In the absence of other major sporting events, the Candidates Tournament received unprecedented press coverage this time around.”Although considered a gentleman’s game, cheating is still an issue in chess. It can take many forms — from taking strategic bathroom breaks, to creating fictitious records of games that never happened, or relying on the help of computer chess engines when playing online.Blockchain-based ‘anti-cheating engine’Merenzon believes that blockchain technology can help identify and prevent such unsportsmanlike behavior:“We are working on the anti-cheating engine that may record over one hundred data points for each move — its timestamp, players’ biometrics, chess engine evaluation, etc. Storing this data in the decentralized database would make a lot of sense”Merenzon also shared with Cointelegraph that Algorand and World Chess have been working on a project that will:“introduce blockchain into chess. The project is expected to launch in a few weeks.”Algorand’s spokesperson released a statement to Cointelegraph which elaborates the rationale behind the partnership:“Algorand's partnership with World Chess is exciting because of the overlap of early blockchain adopters, computer science experts and chess enthusiasts. World Chess is focused on bringing new technology to the forefront of their traditional game and Algorand is proud to be partnering with the organization to drive mainstream adoption of both chess and blockchain.”The 2020 Candidates Tournament will convene at a later date once the situation becomes less volatile. The match for the world title is currently scheduled for November."

In the comments section, BitBay sought to calm their increasingly concerned customers, assuring that “all fiat and crypto funds are safe” and requesting “a little more trust’ while the exchange worked to rectify the outage.Customers’ anxieties growBut with no end to the outage in sight, BitBay’s users began to voice suspicions the ‘network problem’ was a cover story for a much bigger issue. Seven hours after the previous post, the exchange tweeted that it would soon be informing customers as to “the current status and plans to recover the platform” and emphasized that users’ funds were safe and that the interruption had not been caused by an attack from a hacker.In a tweet around 1AM BitBay said it had run into more issues and that “despite the hard work of our team and the constant contact with the server service provider, we were unable to start the infrastructure in 100%.” The exchange added that it was working toward relaunching the platform as soon as possible, and provided a link to a status page concerning the disruption.BitBay posts recent volume recordsThe outage comes just two weeks after the exchange posted a new record for daily trade volume in nearly six years of operation. On March 13, the former Poland-based exchange hosted roughly $75 million in daily trade between BTC and PLN. Polish traffic comprises one-third of the exchange’s traffic.Despite the outage, BitBay appears to have facilitated nearly $40 million in trade over the past 24 hours."

42023, Cryptocurrency is a Failure as a Currency Says Brazil's Banking Chief ,2020-03-27t00:34:00+00:00,3152,144,"The President of the Brazilian Banking Federation, Murilo Portugal, has argued that cryptocurrencies are not really currencies at all.Portugal was speaking in a debate about the 'Impact of the Digital Revolution on the Financial System' at the non-profit think tank, the Fernando Henrique Cardoso Foundation. The debate examined the impact of new technologies on financial services, including blockchain, cryptocurrency, big data, artificial intelligence and fintech.Portugal argued that “cryptocurrencies do not fulfill any of the classic functions of the currency"" and said they are not a unit of account, or a means of exchange, or a store of value.""They are actually called coins but they are not coins, which is why it is cryptocurrency. They do not fulfill any of the classic functions of the currency, which is to serve as an account unit, where people can express prices. They do not serve as a means of payment or as a store of value because the volatility is very high.""Portugal is a respected figure in the financial world, he has a degree in Economic Development from Cambridge and has served as an executive director of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.He went on to theorize that money and information are becoming one and the same — predicting that data and information will end up being regulated in the same way as money. ""It is an experience that I think we already see happening,"" he said.Bitcoin is a ‘vehicle currency’ in VenezuelaA report published on March 24 by the Open Money Initiative suggests that even in neighbouring Venezuela where hyperinflation is rampant, Bitcoin is not being used as a traditional store of value.The report, by data scientist Matt Ahlborg, looked at the effects of a multi day power blackout in Venezuela and its relationship to trading volume on Localbitcoins, as well as trades between Bitcoin and other South American currencies.It determined Bitcoin is being used as a 'vehicle currency' to transfer value out of Venezuela and that informal money transmitters are holding onto Bitcoin only as long as necessary and converting it as soon as possible to dollars or stablecoins. The report stated:""Bitcoin is being used not as a store of value endpoint, but as a channel on the road to obtain more stable currencies such as the US dollar, Colombian peso, Chinese yuan and various stablecoins.""However Ahlborg concluded this is an incredibly valuable use case for Bitcoin:""It’s not unreasonable to suggest that Bitcoin could have already facilitated billions of dollars worth of censorship-resistant value transfer to and from Venezuela over the last few years. If we take this as a real possibility, then Bitcoin has already played a part in changing the destiny of an entire country.""Is Bitcoin a store of value or a form of money?Bitcoin's ability to serve as a currency is hotly debated. Some argue that Bitcoin is 'digital gold', including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — who launched an advertising campaign around the concept. In a blog post published in February, U.S exchange Coinbase argued that ""Bitcoin is a store of value to rival gold in the digital age”.Cointelegraph's Antonio Madeira explored the question in an article in late February. He spoke to Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of crypto banking app Nexo, who argued Bitcoin is a store of value:“The very early narrative was that Bitcoin was going to be a revolutionary currency and p2p payment system. I think that this has failed to materialize in any way. Bitcoin has the functionalities of a currency but it’s used more as a store of value and transition of value especially in larger quantities.”Madeira wrote that Bitcoin exhibits five of the six features of money — durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply. However he concluded it is currently failing on the sixth, which is general acceptability as a payment method."
42018," Heads of Binance​.US, Ledger, and ZCoin Speak to Impact of Digital Dollar on Industry ",2020-03-26t22:53:00+00:00,2641,85,"COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on the global economy. As legislators in the United States go back and forth on how best to distribute aid, the conversation has amplified the potential role of a digital dollar to avoid the traps of traditional finance.Whether or not ongoing stimulus efforts lead to the minting of a digital dollar, it’s a subject that is on the minds of U.S. legislators in a new way, especially as China’s pending central bank digital currency (CBDC) continues moving forward. Cointelegraph spoke with several leaders in the blockchain industry to get their take on what a digital dollar means for stimulus, government, and crypto.A boost for crypto or just buzzwords?Pascal Gauthier, CEO of crypto hard-wallet maker Ledger, was positive about the prospect of a digital dollar for the company. Even so,he was uncertain as to whether recent legislation would actually bring it into existence.“It's amazing news.” Gauthier told Cointelegraph on what a digital dollar would mean for Ledger. “We're not a fintech company. We're just a tech company. We provide security solutions for critical digital assets and, you know, blockchain-enabled assets. So everything that runs on the blockchain is good for us because we protect the secrets, we protect the private everything that runs on a public blockchain.”CEO of Binance Catherine Coley said that the prospect of a digital dollar was potentially good for adoption all around:“If it is a push towards efforts of the Fed coming forward with their own version of a central bank coin, that would be something that would be fascinating and a good move in the direction of leading the U.S.”Like Gauthier, Coley couched her optimism: “In terms of how that actually affects the adoption rate or the financial inclusion that we see as benefiting from digital assets, it's a little bit different.”Technical limitations of current proposalsPart of the problem with the digital dollar as proposed in some draft versions of the currently circulating stimulus bill is that it would operate strictly via the current financial system, monitored by the Federal Reserve. Coley explained:“They would be using the existing rails and one part that we face is that existing rails oftentimes neglect those that may not have bank accounts or may not be able to go and visit their brick and mortar bank in times like these crises.”Moreover, if the United States is looking to implement a CBDC based on the blockchain, it may face infrastructural hurdles that it has not yet prepared for.Gauthier illustrated a major difference in the way that Bitcoin’s network security grew and how a hypothetical blockchain-based dollar would develop: “The infrastructure question, in general, for crypto assets is a very interesting one. If you see the evolution of Bitcoin, Bitcoin in 2008 is one guy and then two guys, three guys, etc. So you got concentric circles of more people joining in every year.” He continued:“What's going to be interesting with the crypto dollar is it's more of a top-down experience. Suddenly, you have trillions of assets that are in the crypto dollar. Security will be paramount from day one. And so the type of infrastructure that you need to implement from day one to support that is going to be a challenge, for sure.”Coley, who recently wrote an op-ed promoting the use of stablecoins to distribute aid, was skeptical as to the Fed’s ability to implement such a massive initiative at once, given the limited exposure to the technology up til now: “It makes us aware in the United States that we're not there yet at the same level of adoption that the rest of the world is already eager for”“This digital dollar idea seems to be a knee-jerk response. The allure is simple: to have direct access to citizens with minimum red tape and the ability to directly provide dollars to the people, including the unbanked,” said Reuben Yap, COO for privacy token ZCoin. “While I do think that there is benefit in empowering the unbanked, much more detail needs to be fleshed out. This is not something we can rush through.”Is it even blockchain?Given the limited specifications as to any prospective digital dollar coming out of the stimulus package, nobody was confident that the final product would properly fall into the category of blockchain-based cryptocurrency. Yap was adamant: “Creation of a digital dollar is NOT an endorsement of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin or even blockchain.”Slightly more diplomatic, Gauthier said “One of the big questions for the crypto dollar is whether it will run on a public blockchain or not.”Also skeptical, Coley was curious as to what the phrase “digital dollar” would end up meaning. She described her reaction as “relieved to see those words put together but well aware that the situation they're proposing wasn't anything involving stablecoins or digital assets as we know them.” Coley advocated Binance’s dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD, as a more reliably blockchain-backed way for users to access the benefits of the dollar.The issue of international exchangeThe language in current bills identifies a “qualified individual” for the proposed digital dollar wallets as “any individual other than any nonresident alien individual.” This leaves a lingering question: what is the prospective role of these digital dollars abroad, in transacting with foreign nationals or buying commodities across borders?Regarding legislative reaction, Coley said “It would be remiss to say they'd be shocked by that because the U.S. is one of the largest currencies used all around the world. So for the sake of keeping it within the walled garden that is the United States, I don't think that's purposeful or in their best interests.”Gauthier, who lives in France, was direct about the uncertainty surrounding a digital dollar that leaves the U.S., saying “That’s a very tough question because the honest answer is I don't know.”The issue of CBDCs and privacyMany in the crypto community are suspicious of CBDCs writ large, seeing them as a means for governments to monitor private transactions. This is a large part of the conversation surrounding China’s proposed digital renminbi, but given skepticism towards the Federal Reserve among fans of Bitcoin, it's easy to see why the proposed “FedAccounts” might not be cause for celebration.“We need to consider the implications with privacy, as all of these wallets will be tied to an identity,” Yap explained. “This digital dollar could also become a gateway to the removal of physical cash, which is still currently the most private way to perform financial transactions.”Gauthier was similarly doubtful as to whether the digital dollar would be as empowering a force as advertised: “Ownership is the question that remains in the sense that can you own the crypto dollar in the same way that you own cash? Meaning that it's with you, it's on your ledger wallet. Is it anonymous or traceable?”"

These donations will aid in the fight to contain the spread of the coronavirus throughout the U.S.In a tweetpublished on Ripple’s official profile, the lab stated that $100,000 will go to the Tipping Point Emergency’s Response Fund and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation’s COVID Regional Response Fund, respectively.California’s non-profits favored by the Ripple Labs donationTipping Point, which is a San Francisco-based non-profit organization, works to combat poverty in the California city thanks to a network of partners who support the cause. They hope to raise $1 million in total for the COVID-19 response initiative.On the other hand, The Silicon Valley Community Foundation is focused on containing the effects of COVID-19 throughout the Silicon Valley area. This is an especially prescient move during a time when governments around the world have taken measures to ensure that citizens are observing proper social distancing procedures.However, scams impersonating cryptocurrency foundations have also appeared on the scene.YouTube scam impersonating Ripple’s CEOA YouTube scam, previouslyreported by Cointelegraph on March 24, consisted of a YouTube account impersonating Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The account openly promoted a fraudulent crypto airdrop.Garlinghouseposted a warning through his Twitter account, directly addressing the emergence of scammers through YouTube:“Enough is enough -- in a time of global crisis, when people are especially vulnerable -- social platforms need to hold scammers (crypto and otherwise) accountable for stealing money from innocent victims with fake giveaways.”"

Solana is an open-source project that implements permissionless blockchain technology.Solana’s protocol uses a new approach to establish the order of blocks, called Proof-of-History, and will be available at mainnet launch on the Bison Trails platform.As the company details, Solana currently supports 50-65K transactions per second and 400ms block times, with 50 nodes on its public testnet.Benefits attached to the partnershipIn dialogue with Cointelegraph, Joe Lallouz, CEO of Bison Trails, commented on the benefits of the feature:“If you’re a Solana token holder, you can run your own validators or delegate to the Bison Trails validator at mainnet launch. As additional features like archiver clients and storage rent come online, Bison Trails customers will be able to run additional infrastructure to support the network and earn participatory rewards.”Lallouz says that Bison Trails has been working with Solana for over a year, from running one of the first nodes in all testnets, to deploying infrastructure on both physical hardware and in the cloud.Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s founder and CEO, stated the following:“At Solana, we’re developing a scaling solution for blockchains that can uniquely capitalize on improvements in hardware and bandwidth. Because of this approach, the upfront and on-going resources required to participate as a validator in the Solana network can be more demanding than other protocols.”New projects ahead for 2020Looking ahead, Bison Trails CEO told Cointelegraph that they will be opening the platform out of limited beta to a wider market. They announced a new network roadmap which includes: Cardano, Celo, Coda, ETH 2.0, Keep, Libra, Near, NuCypher, Oasis, Polkadot, Skale, and TON.Lallouz also said that the funding round completed in Q4 2019 will allow them to grow as a team to seek new opportunities through new partnerships with exchanges."
42013, Is Now the Time to Invest in Bitcoin? ,2020-03-26t22:01:00+00:00,13116,96,"With global markets tumbling out of control, will Bitcoin finally fulfill its role as a hedge asset? Is now a good time to invest in Bitcoin?CEO and co-founder of Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan and trader Michaël van de Poppe discuss how the Fed’s strategy of ‘QE to Infinity’ will help Bitcoin finally become a safe haven asset. But is now the time to buy or should you wait for further drops? Watch the full video to find out!Bitcoin’s Key LevelIn an article for Cointelegraph, Michaël identified $6,800-6,900 as the key level to watch. Unless Bitcoin is able to break through that level, he’s not very optimistic about upward movements:“Until we don't do that, I expect further downside to comments, just pure technical levels.”Mati is also watching those levels, but he is more focused on the long term than the short term:“So first of all, I only have bullish scenarios for Bitcoin. Yes, I would say 6,800 is a key level that has played out before…I would say overall, I mean, we're looking at a very wide range for Bitcoin, something between $3,100 and $20,000.”Why ‘QE to Infinity’ Is Bullish for BitcoinThe Fed was recently given the greenlight to print as much money as needed to stabilize the US economy. Michaël explained how this could lead to two scenarios which would both benefit Bitcoin:“So what you want to see at some point is that investors run out of the dollar given the inflation or deflation, and start to seek for other assets which are commodities like gold, silver, platinum and Bitcoin. The other scenario is that the crisis just continues to fall down until 2021 or 2022 and the equity markets bottom out, after which the other commodity markets and Bitcoin start to outperform the equity markets in the first case, which we have seen in '09 to 2011 with gold. So in the end, quantitative easing: I expect that to be bullish for Bitcoin.”Mati continued Michaël’s comparison of Bitcoin to gold in the post-2008 era:“If you look at that and the aftermath to the financial crisis, which was, really as Michaël said, 2009, 2011, 2012. That's when gold really took the center stage… It shot up $2,000 per ounce by 2011, 2012.”“And I think that gold, again, is already showing us incredible resilience since the beginning of the year. And I say if it went up or down during the crisis because it's kind of been fluctuating, but it certainly hasn't taken a hit like the stocks have, it's more or less held its value over that time. And I believe that Bitcoin will also be seen as this type of asset.”But the question remains: is now the time to invest or are there more downturns to be expected?

42010, EOS to Become More ‘Community-Driven’ as Block.One Seeks to Use Dfuse’s Open-Source APIs ,2020-03-26t23:30:00+00:00,1559,83,"The technology stack behind Dfuse’s advanced blockchain APIs has been made open-source, according to a March 19 announcement. These APIs are primarily used in EOS development. Cointelegraph took the opportunity to interview the CTO of Dfuse, Alexandre Bourget, who revealed some of the far-reaching consequences of this for the EOS community.What is Dfuse?Dfuse provides a high-performance set of APIs to read blockchain data, primarily on EOS and Eosio-based platforms, as well as on Ethereum (ETH).As Bourget explained to Cointelegraph, EOS’ fast blockchain times make it difficult to implement software that reads blockchain data, like blockchain explorers.Dfuse solves some of these issues by taking concrete snapshots of the blockchain, though it also supports real time reading and several other features.For Ethereum, Dfuse provides data that “is not present in the nodes,” such as tracing cascading contract executions and other complex interactions. Bourget noted that many developers had to deal with the same complexities to develop their own projects, but nobody has provided a service to simplify this process before. Dfuse began life as a project from EOSCanada, one of EOS’ few dozen block producers.Open-sourcing is a major decisionFor a company like Dfuse, the technology stack can be considered as one of the main competitive advantages in selling its product. Bourget nevertheless said that open-sourcing critical software components is nothing new in the blockchain world, which openly values a higher degree of transparency and decentralization.As the technology matured, the company realized that it could safely make its software open-source in a way that empowers its users.From a business standpoint, the open-source model also provides advantages:“We see there’s a nice fit for the future — the tech being there, people improving the platform mostly from the edge integrations. The core team develops the core technology and many people develop those edge integrations.”Edge integrations would allow entities to connect the API to different platforms, with Bourget citing examples like Apache Kafka.Bourget also explained that the company’s presence will be strongly needed for enterprise:“Enterprises have very critical things that they want to pay for, like service level agreements, support. They need to be supported, especially regarding blockchain, because [...] blockchains are mostly going to be mission critical.”Block.one changing its cooperation modelBlock.One, the company developing EOSio’s technology, is generally considered the main developer of the EOS network. It was the recipient of EOS’ $4 billion initial coin offering, a fact that generated significant regulatory scrutiny.In addition to open-sourcing Dfuse, Block.One also revealed that it would seek to integrate its technology into EOSio — the name of the blockchain technology used in EOS.Bourget argues that, so far, Block.One has been very cautious in interacting with the EOS network — they even made efforts to strike all references to their being an EOS developer in the media. He continued:So that's a notable shift. [Before] they settled with the SEC they were very wary to never touch any block production on EOS [...] They would say, ‘look, you buy EOS, but we’re not going to give you a network. You’re giving that as revenue for us to build the program.’”He also noted that Block.One recently purchased EOS New York, another founding block producer. Bourget was positive about the changes, saying that they open EOS to becoming a more community-driven network. He added:“There's a lot of knowledge in block producers who have actually made money out of [EOS]. [...] So that’s maybe a shift to be more community-centric, which will improve the speed at which [EOS] could rise and become more meaningful.”"
42009, National Digital Currencies: Not Yet Too Big to Fail ,2020-03-26t21:49:00+00:00,2397,91,"Over 30 years ago, in a January 1988 cover story emblazoned with a phoenix hovering over a paper-money inferno, The Economist offered this semi-prophetic vision of currency:“Thirty years from now, Americans, Japanese, Europeans, and people in many other rich countries, and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency. Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let’s say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favoured by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today’s national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.”That piece stoked nationalist fears, and perhaps globalist hopes, about an international currency that could one day be an alternative to fiat limited by borders. Far from quaint, the currencies listed by The Economist are still very much in use with no signs of going anywhere, though those nationalist fears have perhaps been inflamed over the last decade-plus with the rollout of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other cryptocurrencies. When it comes to crypto, nations have largely remained on the sidelines, except when acting as reactive regulators to these private first movers.Related: Should Crypto Stay Decentralized or Are CBDCs Better? Experts AnswerBut time’s arrow only points forward, and after we’ve already digitized nearly everything else in our lives, it’s only inevitable that we would want to digitize our most valuable asset: the very notion of value itself.Related: Central Banks Are Exploring Blockchain — but for Their Own ReasonsHowever, a “greenback” — or any other piece of physical currency — is also the most complex experiment in this march of digitization yet, representing a variety of sometimes conflicting elements: assets, debt history, payment history, and national identity and pride. Nations should be careful about how they proceed, as governments find it difficult enough to digitize things like national health care, and citizens should be wary of how exactly those nations choose to proceed.The cautionary tale of the PetroOne nation that proceeded with a national digital currency and definitely didn’t succeed was Venezuela, home of the unmitigated disaster that was the Petro. Venezuela wrote the handbook on how not to launch a digital currency. Like the Greek myth of Icarus flying too close to the sun, Venezuela saw the shiny object that was the crypto industry and tried to go too far, way too fast.Related: Venezuela President Maduro Is Not Pro-Crypto, He Just Likes PetroInitially launching in early 2018, the Petro’s rate was tied to one barrel of oil, with 100 million coins issued. On some level, it may have made sense to start moving Venezuela’s most precious resource to the blockchain. However, like far too many before it, Venezuela’s toe dip into crypto was born out of desperate greed, not because it was the best mechanism for the country to execute on what it wanted to accomplish. The Petro was built on a slapdash white paper that cribbed significant portions from that of the open-source altcoin Dash.Related: Venezuelan Petro Against US Sanctions: History and Use of the CryptoFailure reared its head where faith would not. The Petro lacked credibility at home and internationally, squeezing it out of any potential global markets and leaving it dead on arrival. The one place where the Petro had any traction, according to former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez, was “in the government’s imagination.”Related: Venezuela on Fire: How Maduro’s Petro Plan Failed to Bail OutAside from what was generally shoddy preparation for such an ambitious initiative, the Petro also suffered from existing on a centralized ledger under the control of what was, by all appearances, a very unreliable government. Normally, backing crypto reserves with oil might have actually worked, but it also required faith in the Venezuelan government to do what it said it was going to do regarding oil extraction.So, what did we learn from Venezuela? Most of all, desperation is not the best position for launching a cryptocurrency. An unstable currency is going to be just as unstable in the digital realm as it is on paper. In addition, any limited controls exercised by governments should be as decentralized as possible, as a single asset isn’t enough to support said currency, even when the asset is as important as oil.Governments cannot just dip their toes into the crypto waters. They must provide an alternative beyond the implied power of fiat that beats existing digital currencies at their own game. In a world where both data and money now move nearly at the speed of light, governments will have to do more than offer regulatory chokeholds. They must offer a better product.Vires in numerisAs we start the new decade, there will undoubtedly be additional attempts at national digital currencies, attempts that benefit or suffer from varying levels of success. National control over currency and fiat is evolving as media, digital payments and even the nature of work continue to be shaped by computing, automation and our increasingly digital lives. However, those currencies that don’t want to meet the same fate as the Petro must offer a margin of speed and ease of use over non-state competitors, such as Bitcoin.Related: Russia Leads Multinational Stablecoin InitiativeI was working in the cybersecurity sector when Edward Snowden leaked the National Security Agency’s PRISM program, and the thought in the community was that government snooping on internet traffic and private communications was such a big violation of people’s rights that they would rebel and start to demand freedom. The reality is that, several years later, nothing has changed. People choose to give up their freedom for the ability to use the internet, and the monitoring of the internet is now even more invasive. It’s not so much that people trade liberty for security, but that they trade liberty for security and convenience.This is something for both the first wave of private cryptocurrencies and the potential second wave of national digital currencies to keep in mind. People hold Bitcoin to resist censorship and control by banks or governments, but the reality comes down to two things: The majority of the population does not care for these features if it is more inconvenient to use than traditional methods, and all cryptocurrencies — no matter how they are implemented — are controlled by a select few.Related: China’s Digital Yuan Is an Economic Cyberweapon, and the US Is DisarmingThe adoption of cryptocurrency will not come from the average person on the street demanding censorship-resistant digital money. People don’t care about censorship resistance, as I learned during my research on TOR. Adoption of cryptocurrency will come from the banks and from those nations looking to provide the people with a faster, more secure way to transmit money.Cryptocurrency should not be wrapped up in a political statement, and such statements are implicit in government rollouts of such initiatives. This is what we’ve already seen with the Petro. That type of notion harms the technology. Rather, we should look at holistically offering the best solution for crypto that implements the best ideas of all vested interests. That means buy-in from everybody who touches the finance sector and is working on its problems: not just governments that may release these currencies, but consumers, technologists, and yes, even banks. Sorry to the anti-bank cultists out there.The internet did not succeed because it was able to make a political statement. It was successful because it was a way of distributing information in a quicker method than was previously possible. The cryptocurrencies that succeed will do so for similar reasons: because they allow for better, faster and more secure payments, with better audit trails. If nations really want to build attractive digital currencies, that’s where their focus should continue to be.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Richard Dennis is the founder and CEO of TemTum, a quantum-secure and environmentally friendly cryptocurrency.

42006, WFE Brass Weighs in on Crypto Securities Classification Debate ,2020-03-26t23:00:00+00:00,1318,69,"Are cryptocurrencies securities or commodities? The World Federation of Exchanges, or WFE, released a document talking cryptocurrency terminology and regulation last week. In conversation with Cointelegraph, WFE Head of Regulatory Affairs, Richard Metcalfe, has added further clarity on the subject.“The WFE believes that, precisely because the market in crypto assets has evolved and expanded rapidly, existing regulation should apply wherever appropriate, in a universal and clearly understood manner and based on key principles,” Metcalfe told Cointelegraph in an email.Cryptocurrencies classification remains debatableCryptocurrency has seen increasing public attention since its inception roughly a decade ago. A debate still exists across a number of parties on whether various crypto assets are securities, commodities, or neither.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, classified Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as commodities, but the jury is still out on many other assets, including high market cap asset, XRP.“With regard to crypto currencies specifically, some individuals may hold them as a form of speculative investment (just as others may hold wine, or art, or other assets that do not constitute financial instruments, including utility tokens),” Metcalfe said, adding:“However, unless the currency provides holders with any of the rights usually associated with securities, then there is no need to treat them as such.”Asset categories within crypto depend on several factorsThe WFE released a 17-page report on March 20, laying out its response to the European Union’s crypto-related overwatch guidelines. The document discussed cryptocurrency terminology and the weight such verbiage carries in light of regulation, among other topics.In his follow-up comments to Cointelegraph, Metcalfe mentioned cryptocurrencies in relation to the power, or lack of power, they hold. Owning a security, such as stock shares for example, can give the holder part company ownership, certain voting rights, and sometimes also pay dividends. This is not the case with many cryptocurrencies.“Where any crypto asset does have the characteristics of a security (for example, rights and obligations akin to those offered by shares), it should be treated as such under existing regulations,” Metcalfe told Cointelegraph. “This is to ensure a level playing field, provide clarity and a technology neutral approach.”Metcalfe added:“For the same level-playing-field reasons, where a crypto asset forms the underlying for derivatives, then that should not excuse participants from regulatory obligations associated with other derivatives.”Crypto derivatives trading, such as Bitcoin futures trading, have also gained prominence over the last two years. As more of these products come into play, amid the U.S. SEC’s continued action against numerous ICOs, governing bodies may need to adapt to changing times and technology."
42005, The Mysterious Founder of Cross-Chain Protocol Reveals His Identity ,2020-03-26t22:30:00+00:00,3065,93,"The NULS Technical Community (NULS) has released a blueprint for Nerve Network, a cross-chain protocol. Until now, the mysterious mastermind behind the network was known only known as “Berzeck”.Vitalik’s dream come trueNerve Network is tackling the same issue as Cosmos (Atom) and Polkadot — a lack of cross-chain interoperability. This is something that Vitalik Buterin has recently lamented about:“We should put resources toward a proper (trustless, serverless, maximally Uniswap-like UX) ETH <-> BTC decentralized exchange. It's embarrassing that we still can't easily move between the two largest crypto ecosystems trustlessly.”Nerve Network has two layers of super-nodes. The first layer consists of 35 nodes and is similar to EOS. On top of that, there is a second layer of 15 so-called “Bank nodes”. These manage various crypto assets that may be deployed on the network.Reaper Ran, NULS founder, believes that Nerve Network is ready to take on competition:“Over the past year, NULS developers have made 4,324 GitHub commits, the fifth most of any blockchain project. Internationally, we see greater enthusiasm as we approach cross-chain functionality, and with our modular functionality, we are on pace to outperform all other incumbents.”In the case of Bitcoin (BTC), Bank nodes will have multi-signature addresses to which users will be sending their funds. If a Bank node misbehaves, it receives a “yellow card”, which denotes its negative activity. Persistent bad behavior warrants the issuance of a “red card”, further increasing the node’s negative status on the network.In addition to providing cross-chain interoperability, developers will be able to use NULS-inherent smart contracts with the Bitcoin network. Similar to the Lightning Network, Nerve Network will make Bitcoin microtransactions possible by lowering costs.The big revealSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Berzeck explained that his motivation for not disclosing his identity was rather prosaic:“I am a very practical man, in Bolivia, the old government [under Evo Morales] was very much against crypto, so I was afraid. But, now the new government [under Jeanine Añez] is much more friendly. So, I don’t mind publicizing my name if it helps the project gain credibility.”Berzeck’s real name is Mario Blacutt.The lack of interoperability amongst various blockchain networks needs to be addressed if this technology is to gain mass adoption."
42003, Cryptocurrency Accounting Firm Launches Library of Legal and Tax Advice ,2020-03-26t22:00:00+00:00,1867,95,"Cryptocurrency accounting and tax software provider, Lukka, has announced the launch of the Lukka Library — an interactive collection of academic papers addressing legal, accounting, and tax questions pertaining to crypto assets.On March 26, Cointelegraph spoke to Lukka co-CEO, Robert Materazzi, and Lukka Library creator and head of tax and regulatory affairs, Roger Brown.“People weren’t interested in paying their taxes in 2014”Materazzi states that the company was formed under its former brand, Libra, in 2014 after the founder “Googled how to pay his capital gains tax and found that there wasn't any solution that was out there.”The experience prompted the founder to rope together some developers to build what Robert claims was the first cryptocurrency tax calculator. However, the product failed to make an impact as “people weren’t interested in paying their taxes in 2014 relating to crypto.”After the 2017 bull run pushed Bitcoin (BTC) towards the mainstream and gave rise to a proliferation in crypto hedge funds, the firm decided to shift its focus towards institutions.Brown states that they then set about drafting a list of 170 issues relating to crypto tax for which they state “there was either no IRS guidance, or the IRS guidance on the topic was overly broad and missed the nuances in their facts.”Lukka Library covers more than 75 topicsRoger asserts that more than 75 topics are currently covered in the Lukka Library, including a wide array of taxation strategies for crypto traders, and suggestions on how to value digital assets that experience high volatility for institutions.The resource currently contains articles written by more than two dozen authors, including the University of Pennsylvania, in addition to legal firms McDermott Will & Emery, Steptoe & Johnson, Mayer Brown, and Baker & Hostetler.Lukka’s users can also request articles addressing desired topics and can access the authors featured in the library’s collection.Annual access to the Lukka Library is currently priced at $99.95 per year.Roger adds that the platform is soliciting content internationally, starting with an emphasis on the U.K.Brown on U.S. digital dollar proposalsLooking forward, Materazzi asserts that Lukka believes “crypto assets and digital assets are the future,” adding: “finally all the regulators and governments are catching up to this right now.”Brown agrees, contending that the said future may be arriving sooner than previously anticipated, citing recent proposals for a U.S.-government backed digital dollar.“The US has two bills in Congress and one in the House, one in the Senate that talk about digitizing the dollar and the digitization not only just at the institutional level [...] but they're also going to creating a digital wallet for each U.S. person to, in effect, no longer have to deal with currency. And that's incredibly important. Not only for technology, the savings around sending it, the security also associated with it[...] but digital assets are more traceable than cash. So that could be part of the reason why Congress is enacting it.”He adds: “People say you could get the coronavirus from touching money in coins, you can't do that by touching digital assets.”"

This does not suggest that a decoupling effect occurred last week.However, in the same period, gold and Bitcoin returns correlated at only 37.2%. In a contrasting scenario, it seems that the correlation between Bitcoin and market indexes is much stronger – at 73% with the S&P 500 and 79% with the Nasdaq.As a benchmark, the week from March 9 to March 13, presented an even stronger correlation between Bitcoin and market indexes (around 79%) and a much stronger relationship with gold (91.6%).Since Bitcoin’s correction happened (Feb. 19 to March 13), the relationship with gold is still slightly stronger than its relationship to major market indexes.Sentiment data shows investors trust Bitcoin and goldNevertheless, as seen from sentiment correlations provided by analytics firm The Tie, Bitcoin and gold sentiment seem to go hand in hand during the month of March and this relationship has been increasing significantly since April 2019.This shows investors feel that both Bitcoin and gold could be the strongest options to recover their investments amid the current global economic tsunami.Sentiment correlations between BTC, Gold and the S&P 500.

42002, Coinbase Wallet Integrates Support for DeFi Lending Apps ,2020-03-26t21:00:00+00:00,2394,104,"Leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, has integrated support for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on its wallet app.Per a March 26 announcement, Coinbase Wallet will now allow users to earn interest on cryptocurrencies through the DeFi apps, Compound, and dYdX.While the DeFi apps were already available through Coinbase Wallet’s built-in decentralized application browser, the exchange asserts that the integration significantly increases the ease-of-use for users seeking to access DeFi protocols.The new feature will roll out for iOS this week, with Android support slated to follow in the near future.Coinbase Wallet integrates support for DeFi protocols Compound and dYdXWith the integrations, Coinbase Wallet will support lending for Ethereum (ETH) in addition to a range of Ethereum-based tokens.Both Compound and dYdX comprise algorithmically-driven automated lending platforms built on top of Ethereum, with dYdX also offering margin trading services.While lending interest rates are floating, the annual returns offered by Compound and dYdX ranged from 0.03% to 4.17% at the time of Coinbase’s announcement.Funds worth nearly $79 million are locked up in Compound at press time. DYdX’s smart contracts currently manage more than $20 million.The security risks of decentralized applicationsThe exchange states that the integrations will allow users to earn interest on their crypto holdings in just a few taps, adding that users can quickly cash out by withdrawing their crypto from the DeFi smart contracts to their wallet.Despite the company's optimism regarding the integrations, Coinbase urges users to exercise caution when exploring DeFi applications —stating that “DeFi lending apps are relatively nascent and come with risks.”“DeFi apps are programs running on the blockchain, and like any computer code they can potentially have bugs that cause you to lose money. Returns are not guaranteed and your deposits are not insured.”ZenGo warns of major Dapp security vulnerabilityOn March 23, crypto wallet company ZenGo published a report seeking to highlight a major security flaw in the interaction between decentralized applications’ (Dapps) smart contracts and crypto users’ wallets.The report asserts that when a user grants a smart contract permission to execute a single transaction involving their wallet, the Dapp is granted full control over all of the tokens held within that wallet.ZenGo also highlights that the authorization is permanent, meaning that even users who have ceased to use a Dapp are still vulnerable to the flaw.Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for commentary regarding the new integrations and the security flaws associated with Dapps.

41997," Binance Releases Its Own Debit Card, Initial Testing Will Be in Malaysia ",2020-03-26t20:04:00+00:00,4083,228,"Binance enters the crypto debit card sector with news of an official Binance Card on March 26. Issued by Visa, the card will initially be available in South East Asia, though other regions will be unlocked soon, the company states.Like most other crypto cards, the Binance Card allows its users to spend their cryptocurrencies by converting them into fiat and piggy-backing off established debit card networks.A fairly unique aspect of the Binance Card is that its internal balance will be in cryptocurrencies, initially Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin (BTC).As Josh Goodbody, head of growth at Binance Card, explained to Cointelegraph:“Initially, users can deposit BNB and BTC to their Binance Cards directly from their Binance.com wallet or any other crypto wallet.”During the testing period, the card’s transaction currency will be the U.S. dollar. This means that clients outside of the United States may need to pay foreign exchange fees for most purchases.Nevertheless, Goodbody reassures that local currencies will be made available throughout the year.During Binance Card’s beta testing period in April, it will only be available to residents of Malaysia. Ordering the card costs $15, though the company promises that there will be no monthly or yearly maintenance fees.The card will also be paired with its own app to help manage it, including handling deposits from Binance exchange accounts, viewing transaction history, and changing the card’s PIN.Binance’s global visionThe exchange has been on a roll since early 2019, expanding into many different branches of the crypto industry. Throughout the year, Binance posted achievements such as hosting the first major initial exchange offering, launching its own blockchain, U.S. subsidiary, decentralized exchange, and derivatives platform.Many of its co-founders, notably the CEO Changpeng Zhao, have repeatedly stated that their vision for cryptocurrency has a much wider reach than just an exchange — their goal is to disrupt and revolutionize the entire financial system.The cryptocurrency card is the natural evolution of that vision. As Goodbody elaborated, the company plans to make the card available globally:“We’ll first introduce the beta version of the Binance Card in Malaysia this April, and we’ll add more regions throughout the rest of this year. We see this as a global product.”Binance is also constantly expanding its fiat bridge options, integrating multiple banking and debit card partners to let users purchase crypto as easily as possible anywhere around the globe.The exchange’s leadership in the Blockchain space carries a responsibility toward the community. Binance was recently embroiled in a scandal where its customers’ funds were used as a weapon in Steem’s governance battle."
41995, Bitcoin in the Palm of Your Hand — Crypto Hardware Wallets Review ,2020-03-26t19:47:00+00:00,6981,93,"A hardware wallet may just be the safest way to store cryptocurrency for average users. Nowadays, many different devices are trying to tackle the challenges of secure crypto asset storage. In this article, Cointelegraph will review some of the most well-known hardware wallets and compare their features.The cryptocurrency wallets that will be covered in this article are Ledger’s Nano X and Nano S, SatoshiLabs’s Trezor One and Trezor Model T, ShapeShift’s KeepKey, and Coinkite’s Coldcard and Opendime. It is also important to point out that all the wallets tested in this article, other than the Ledger Nano S (which was already owned), have been provided by the producers, free of charge.Ledger devicesLedger’s Nano S and Nano X are similar devices when it comes to their functionality. Both interact with the same software, run the same applications and support the same cryptocurrencies, according to the firm’s official website.The Nano X is different from all the other devices in this article because it is the only one that is rechargeable and works wirelessly via Bluetooth. However, during the tests, the device’s wireless connectivity was only functional with the Ledger Live mobile application.Ledger Live allows users to update the device and to manage a significant portion of the crypto assets supported by the device. The rest of the assets are accessible through third-party software that is compatible with the hardware wallet.Another advantage that the Nano X has over the Nano S is the larger and higher resolution screen. While no one will be watching movies on either device, the fact that an entire wallet address fits on the screen helps when checking where the assets are being sent.The Nano S can hold fewer — under 10 in the tests — applications than the Nano X, which is advertised to hold up to 100. Not having the app of a crypto asset installed precludes the ability to manage it, but uninstalling and reinstalling the application does not imply a loss of cryptocurrency. Consequently, the limitation in the number of installed apps of the Nano S results only in a minor inconvenience.Both wallets can be used on mobile devices, but the Nano S only works with a USB on-the-go cable. Third-party mobile apps also support both the Nano X and S. The Nano X is available on the official Ledger website for around $120, while the Nano S is just short of $60.Trezor devicesThe SatoshiLabs’s Trezor One and Trezor Model T hardware wallets, on the other hand, share fewer similarities than the Ledger devices. The Model T has a larger color touch screen than the One, a micro SD card slot and a reversible USB C connector. Yet, both support about 1,000 crypto assets.The micro SD card slot in the Model T allows for signing transactions in an offline environment and saving them onto the memory card. The transactions could then be transmitted to the network from a second device that is connected to the internet. However, this functionality has not been added to the device yet.In order to operate Trezor, the hardware wallet needs to be connected to a computer or a mobile device that runs dedicated software. This software can be Trezor's purpose-built Google Chrome browser extension or a third-party, web-based wallet. Moreover, the device has all the expected functionalities, as well as an intuitive user interface. Like Ledger’s devices, the Trezor hardware wallets are also supported by a long list of third-party software wallets.SatoshiLabs also provides a mobile wallet that allows device initialization, recovery, label change, pin change, passphrase management, firmware upgrade and a full device wipe. Mobile wallets, such as Mycelium or Walleth, allow users to manage their crypto assets from a mobile device, although only via a cable.Furthermore, the Trezor web-based wallet can also be accessed through the Android version of Google Chrome when the wallet is connected to the mobile device. According to the company’s website, the Trezor One is available for $55, while the Trezor T is just a little short of $170. The Corazon Titanium Trezor Model T — sold by Gray in a partnership with Trezor — costs about four times more than the standard version, which was also tested.KeepKeyAlthough it’s lesser-known but is still a major player on the market, the KeepKey surprises with its large black and white screen and premium feel. The materials used for the front of the device make it hard to clean and can be easily scratched.The device is significantly larger than the other ones in this list, and the number of digital assets supported is severely limited when compared with Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. The KeepKey supports eight cryptocurrencies but also allows users to manage all their Ethereum-based tokens compliant with the ERC-20 standard.During the testing phase of the review, some bugs were encountered in the dedicated software. The application stopped during an attempt to add an account, and it ran into multiple issues when unlocking the wallet.Fortunately, no such bugs interfered when testing the beta version of the cryptocurrency management and trading interface developed by ShapeShift. It is worth pointing out that the ShapeShift service is not a KeepKey exclusive but is also supported in Ledger and Trezor devices.Coldcard and OpendimeColdCard is an open-source hardware wallet that closely resembles a calculator and targets more tech-savvy users. The Opendime, on the other hand, is closer to a real-life version of the cyberpunk credit chips or a piggy bank than a traditional hardware wallet.The Coldcard wallet only supports Bitcoin (BTC) and is the only wallet in this review that supports the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions format. This feature allows users to sign transactions, save them onto the SD card, and broadcast them at a later time — and co-sign them in the case of a multi-signature wallet.The Opendime wallet is a single-use device that needs to be physically altered in order to spend the cryptocurrency. When it is first activated by inserting the device into the computer’s USB port, the user has to input random data onto its drive. The wallet then uses this data to generate a private–public key pair.Once the device is initiated, users can see their public keys and send cryptocurrencies to it. What users cannot do is access the private key, which means they cannot move the coins.In order to access the private key, the device's owner has to puncture the device in an indicated spot, permanently altering its electronic circuit. After piercing the Opendime device, users gain access to the private key that can be used to move the cryptocurrency to a software wallet.This device can be viewed as a way to transform a digital currency into a physical currency. When accepting an Opendime as a means of payment, its balance can be verified while users can feel confident that no one will spend the balance without accessing the device.This unique device is the perfect choice for some atypical situations. However, the fact that physical access to the Opendime device automatically translates into access to the cryptocurrency precludes its use in most cases.Coinkite only sells the Bitcoin version of the Opendime device, but the Litecoin Foundation has one for Litecoin (LTC) as well. Coinkite’s official shop sells the Coldcard for a little under $120 and the Opendime in packs of three for just short of $45.Views and beliefs expressed in the article are of the author, Cointelegraph does not endorse any of the products or projects mentioned."

Questionable activities like that.”Crypto fraudsters try to benefit on the coronavirus-driven panicNewsom thus joined the ranks of other global authorities, who are concerned of cryptocurrency fraudsters trying to capitalize on the widespread coronavirus fears. More recently, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission cautioned the public that scammers commonly use major news events like the spread of COVID-19 in order to add credibility to their scam schemes or manipulate emotions.The United Kingdom police also issued a warning against COVID-19 scammers, after it identified 21 cases of fraud involving the virus, earlier in March.Some online perpetrators are even impersonating the World Health Organization in an attempt to steal cryptocurrency donations to fight the COVID-19 pandemic."
41985," Telegram Is Losing to the US SEC, TON Community Can Launch Network Regardless ",2020-03-26t17:00:00+00:00,3549,66,"As Telegram’s legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission continues to unfold, the U.S. authorities have convinced the judge to bar the company from issuing Gram tokens — at least in the near future.On March 24, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York judge said that the SEC “has shown a substantial likelihood of success” in proving that Telegram, the firm behind the eponymous open-source encrypted messenger, distributed unregistered securities.” As a result, the federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against the company, preventing it from delivering Gram tokens to investors.Telegram has already filed a notice of appeal, meaning that the ruling will be reviewed — but experts are pessimistic about the firm’s chances. Meanwhile, the Telegram Open Network community stresses that it has all the tools to proceed with the launch, regardless of what the authorities decide.SEC vs. Telegram — How it all startedThe SEC took Telegram to court in October last year, announcing that it was suing the firm and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TON Issuer, for holding an unregistered token sale. Telegram made waves after it raised almost $1.7 billion for its blockchain platform called Telegram Open Network, or TON, in two private token sale rounds, held in February and March 2018.Telegram’s co-founders, Russian entrepreneurial brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, began developing the blockchain-based platform in 2017. The project aims to facilitate payments and host decentralized applications at high scalability levels. TON is a proof-of-stake platform, meaning that it relies on validators who run nodes to authenticate new blocks and govern the network. For their services, validators are rewarded with the native currency called Gram. If released, TON will likely be integrated into the Telegram app, which boasts over 200 million users worldwide, leapfrogging the app to mass adoption.According to reports, at this point, the product has nearly been finished for almost half a year. In early October 2019, Telegram published the entire TON source code on GitHub and announced that the launch of its blockchain project would be scheduled for the end of the month.However, on Oct. 11, the SEC stepped in to halt the development. The agency had obtained a temporary restraining order against Telegram and TON, seeking “certain emergency relief,” as well as permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties based on the claim that around a quarter of the raised sum, $424.5 million, allegedly belonged to 31 buyers located in the U.S.Notably, Telegram’s initial coin offering was not public. Only those investing a minimum of $1 million were allowed to partake in the TON offering, per the documents Pavel Durov filed with the SEC. By doing so, Telegram was likely looking to use a legal loophole of sorts — according to public documents from 2018, Telegram had informed the SEC that both of its twin $850 million offerings were allegedly made under Rule 506(c) and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933.In Telegram’s view, that meant that because Gram tokens were exclusively sold to accredited investors, the offering was not required to be registered with or qualified by the SEC. Since then, the company has publically emphasized that Grams should not be associated with expectations for profits based on purchase or holding of the token, essentially implying that they do not constitute securities.Regulators oppose this argument. In contrast, it stresses that once the Gram tokens are released, their purchasers and Telegram “will be able to sell billions of Grams into U.S. markets,” and, therefore, continue the unregistered token sale.Despite the major legal problems Telegram is facing, TON investors have been staying calm. In October, soon after the SEC took Telegram to court, they voted against the return of their funds and agreed to a postponement of the network launch until April 30. While it is unclear who exactly participated in the TON sale, media reports suggest that Wall Street-affiliated players, such as venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed Venture Partners, are among those who have invested in the project.How objective is the 70-year old Howey Test?The recent development shows that the court is inclined to side with the regulators and agree that Grams are securities. The main pretext for that is the 1934 Howey Test, which says that a security involves the investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts. U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel wrote:“Considering the economic realities under the Howey test, the Court finds that, in the context of that scheme, the resale of Grams into the secondary public market would be an integral part of the sale of securities without a required registration statement.”The Howey Test, which has largely been used by the SEC when dealing with ICOs, was designed long before cryptocurrencies emerged. As some industry players argue, that might undermine its relevance for the respective cases as Philippe Rodriguez, head of the TON France community, told Cointelegraph:“This [ruling] opens an important debate on the validity of the Howey Test in the context of the creation of a crypto money and financing by a token that is intended to circulate after its purchase.”Nevertheless, some legal experts do not believe that the Howey Test needs major alterations at this point. As Carol Goforth, a law professor at the University of Arkansas, argued in an email conversation with Cointelegraph:“I don’t think we should significantly modify Howey. It is a long-standing precedent that works well to figure out what conventional investment contracts look like. It would be helpful for the Supreme Court to clarify what a ‘common enterprise’ entails, but that has little to do with crypto.”Goforth then went on to explain what specific regulatory adjustments could make handling crypto-related cases more efficient: “My preference would be to take crypto out of the investment contract test by amending the securities laws to specifically designate digital assets as securities; much like stock and notes are defined as securities in the current law.” She argues that an exception could be made for this type of asset when it is sold exclusively to qualified investors who are not swayed by the desire to speculate on a future price increase, adding:“This would have the benefit of allowing the SEC to stop wasting time and money arguing about the Howey test and when and how it applies, and would add certainty to the situation. Ideally, at the same time Congress adds these assets to the definition of security, the SEC could also be directed to provide particularized exemptions based on the need of investors for protection, and the nature of information that is relevant to crypto purchasers.”Lilya Tessler, a partner and the head of Sidley’s fintech and blockchain group, counsel to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a pro-adoption nonprofit that has participated in the case, explained to Cointelegraph that the Howey Test cannot be substituted since it is the existing legal standard applicable in this case. She highlighted that the judge has looked beyond Gram tokens and their digital nature when granted a preliminary injunction:“The court took into consideration the brief I filed on behalf of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which urged the court to ‘distinguish, and not conflate, the subject of an investment contract (the digital asset) with the securities transaction associated with it.’ The judge correctly focused on the contract, transaction, or scheme which is the securities transaction rather than the digital asset itself, which the court notes is ‘little more than alphanumeric cryptographic sequence.’”Telegram is facing serious penalties if it doesn’t complyWhile Telegram sold over $1.7 billion worth of Grams almost two years ago, the assets have yet to be distributed to their buyers because the TON network is still not online. The preliminary injunction prohibits Telegram from delivering the assets.So, what happens to the company now that it’s been banned from releasing Grams? “Note this is a preliminary injunction, which means it only lasts until a final decision or settlement is reached,” says Goforth, noting, however, that “based on the judge’s determination that the SEC has made a showing that will probably win at trial.” That, in turn, could lead to serious consequences for the company if it chooses not to comply. Goforth called that an unlikely scenario:“As for what would happen if Telegram just went ahead and sold in the U.S., the answer is that it would be guilty of a crime for willfully violating the securities laws and the court order. That would subject it and those in control of it, as well as those who aid and abet it, to criminal liabilities, including the risk that assets could be frozen, and bank accounts or other assets here seized.”In any case, Telegram has already submitted a notice of appeal, meaning that the ruling will be reviewed. “Telegram’s counsel has filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal with respect to the court’s decision on the preliminary injunction,” Tessler told Cointelegraph, adding: “The Court of Appeals can rule on this motion while the trial court case is still pending.”Although it could help the firm to buy some extra time, Telegram’s chances of winning the appeal seem slim, as Philip Moustakis, attorney at Seward & Kissel LLP and former SEC senior counsel, told Cointelegraph:“The standard of review on appeal is abuse of discretion — it’s a high bar — meaning Telegram will have to show the district court made some clear mistake of fact or an error of law.”Telegram’s TON is one of the several high-profile ICO cases that have been scrutinized by the SEC — but it seems that the agency could make a show trial out of this case. In September 2019, Block.one, the company behind the most successful ICO in history — which managed to raise over $4 billion during the sale of EOS tokens, more than twice as much as Telegram — reached a civil settlement with the SEC, paying a mere $24-million fine. “The facts and circumstances of each case are different,” Moustakis told Cointelegraph, elaborating:“In the case of Block.one, in my view, the SEC may have felt that there was significant litigation risk, among other things, in the structure of the offering, which was highlighted in the order, with the ERC-20 token offered in the ICO having become fixed and non-transferrable at the close of the sale.”According to Moustakis, however, as the Telegram case unravels, it will serve as a precedent for the litigation of other matters involving ICOs or token offerings. “But this is just one district court decision, and we still need to keep our eye on the Kik Interactive case, and others,” the attorney added.SEC cannot stop the TON launch, says the communityThe Telegram community was hit by the Tuesday ruling but remains overall optimistic. Fedor Skuratov, the founder of the TON Community Foundation, a nonprofit association of TON ecosystem participants, and former communications manager at TON Labs, told Cointelegraph that “the community was ready for this scenario,” adding:“At TCF, we view the judgment as a certainty, which is in any case better than the frozen state of recent months.”Indeed, TON community members have a major card up their sleeve. “TON could always be launched by anyone since all the network code is available,” Daniel Perez, head of TON Spain, told Cointelegraph. “We have several options, including the launch of TON by TCF,” Skuratov confirmed, revealing that several TON test networks have already gone online:“No one can prevent the launch of TON by any other entity, person or a community, [be]cause TON is a decentralized open-source solution. Already, there are two different test networks, and within the community, there is at least 1 group planning to launch the third.”In Perez’s viewpoint, the best option would be if Telegram reaches an agreement similar to the one that Block.one reached with the SEC and then returns back to the network launch. If this doesn’t happen and the community decides to take control, the TON wallet cannot be integrated into the Telegram app, which is a major milestone for the network. “But this does not prohibit the community from creating a custom Telegram client,” said Perez. Moreover, Skuratov told Cointelegraph there is a way to distribute the Gram tokens despite the recent ban:“We are considering, among other things, the option, in which we will negotiate with TON investors on the topic of converting their rights to GRAMs in the Telegram's originally mentioned TON into rights for other GRAMs (they may be called gums, rums, liters, doesn't matter) in any another established TON network selected by the community.”“No one can restrict a self-organized community from acts of goodwill,” Skuratov warned. However, Perez added that the TON community “still hope[s] that this situation will be resolved without us having to go to this extreme.”"
41983, One in Four Trading Firms Have Adopted Crypto in Some Way ,2020-03-26t16:30:00+00:00,2925,125,"A report produced by derivatives analysis firm, Acuiti, has revealed a growing interest in listing crypto assets among institutions, despite lingering compliance concerns. The report was compiled in partnership with exchanges, Bitstamp, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).The study surveyed 86 “senior executives from the buy-side, sell-side, and proprietary trading groups specialized in traditional derivatives trading, clearing and execution.”The report also supplemented its findings by surveying trading firms which specialize in cryptocurrencies.26% of trading firms have adopted crypto assets in some formThe report found that 17% of traditional trading firms have already adopted crypto assets — with adoption defined as “trading or enabling the trading and clearing of at least one digital asset spot or derivatives instrument.”Looking at all trade service providers, the study found that one-in-four respondents support crypto assets. In all markets surveyed, client demand for digital assets was found to far outstrip the willingness of trading firms to list cryptocurrencies.Sell-side firms providing digital asset services are limited to supporting either CME or Bakkt's derivatives — with CME seeing twice the adoption of Bakkt.Crypto assets are ‘on the cusp’ of significant mainstream adoptionThe report found that 45% of the firms that do not currently support crypto assets are planning on revisiting the idea within the next 6 months.Further, 97% of firms indicated a willingness to reconsider their decision within two years.Asian digital asset adoption significantly outpaces North AmericaThe study notes much higher rates of adoption from trading firms based in the Asia-Pacific regions — where adoption rates are 57%. North American firms were found to have the largest differential between demand and adoption — where only half of the demand for digital assets is met.Will Mitting, the managing director of Acuiti, stated that the firm identified “a growing split between demand from traditional trading firms to broaden their coverage of digital assets and the willingness or ability of sell-side firms to provide access.”The majority of firms that have adopted crypto did so within the last 12 months.Institutions identify security and custody as major crypto risksThe survey asked all respondents to cite the three greatest risks that they associate with listing digital assets.Across the board, general security concerns and fears of getting hacked were cited among the chief risks identified. Traditional trading firms also emphasized unease regarding the custody solutions available for storing crypto assets.Both traditional firms and crypto exchanges identify market-making opportunitiesThe report found that market-making was the common strategy employed by both crypto asset exchanges and traditional trading firms.Unlike institutions, crypto exchanges were found to also devote significant resources into over-the-counter trading."
41981, Industry Players Join Former CFTC Royalty on Digital Dollar Project’s New Board ,2020-03-26t15:29:00+00:00,3270,133,"The Digital Dollar Project, which advocates a blockchain-backed digital dollar in the United States, has announced the inaugural roster of its Advisory Board.The new advisors joining the founders of the projectThe project is an initiative of several former heads of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Accenture. The new advisory board includes 22 members with broad backgrounds in finance and payment technologies. They include former CFTC Commissioner Sharon Bowen, PayPal policy exec Usman Ahmed and Georgetown fintech law professor and occasional Cointelegraph contributor Chris Brummer.The announcement for the new board says the advisors aim to “help guide the framework for practical steps that could be taken to establish a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).”The project’s directors include former CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and former Director of the Commission’s fintech office, LabCFTC, Daniel Gorfine. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Giancarlo explained the goal of the board:“We’ve brought together a broad cross-section of individuals — not institutions, but individuals — with experience in monetary policy, central banking, commercial banking, KYC/anti-money laundering, privacy law, constitutional law, economics, accounting, tax — all other disciplines that need to be brought together to examine this and its implications not just for the US economy, but implications for the global economy, where the dollar remains the world’s primary reserve currency.”Question of digital dollar amid U.S. aid?The news comes amid some major back-and-forth for the crypto community, as various versions of the stimulus bill to fight the economic damage wrought by COVID-19 in the U.S. included provisions promoting a digital dollar and affiliate wallets.“We did not have anything to do with what was in that House bill,” Giancarlo told Cointelegraph, but said that legislators may have been inspired by the Project’s language: “We’ve been using the phrase ‘digital dollar’ quite consistently to refer to a US central bank digital currency.”Giancarlo and Gorfine first announced the Digital Dollar Project in January of this year. The initiative built on an October Op-Ed from Giancarlo in which he advocated the need for a blockchain-backed digital dollar."
41978, Why Internet Growth Is a Prime Cryptocurrency-Adoption Driver ,2020-03-26t15:10:00+00:00,2582,160,"As we enter the start of a new decade, the number of internet users has reached a truly astonishing level: Almost 4.5 billion people were active users as of January, encompassing 59% of the global population. With its growing influence on individual consumers and large economies alike, the internet has become a crucial part of our day-to-day lives. Moreover, acceptance of the World Wide Web is growing faster than ever with the rise of mobile technology. Many studies reveal to us an exciting revelation: The development of the web is driving acceptance of cryptocurrency.Digital-currency acceptance is projected to growThe speed of internet adoption is growing fast. According to estimates compiled by Statista, mobile data traffic worldwide is on pace to surpass 77 exabytes per month by 2022, up from 11.5 exabytes per month in 2017.However, truly revolutionary opportunities are quite often missed. For example, the pioneering video-content company RealNetworks was the first to create a video-streaming service, doing so before YouTube was introduced in 2005. But it emerged before the market was ready. as the hardware power of 20 years ago did not allow for mass adoption. Back then, global media found this sort of innovation laughable, while nowadays we see clearly that many YouTube channels greatly outpace television networks in terms of audience numbers. Streaming wasn’t adopted much because the internet was not ready for such innovations back then, but the customers were. This is precisely where the crypto industry is today: There is high demand and the market is trying to keep up.The very same is happening right now with the advent of blockchain and cryptocurrency. This field is greatly underappreciated. According to data from Statista, the number of blockchain wallets has been growing since Bitcoin (BTC) was created in 2009, reaching over 42 million users by the end of September 2019. This represents major progress, especially considering that it took place within a three-year timeline. In the third quarter of 2016, this number was fewer than 9 million.Other recent data suggests that global blockchain-technology revenues will experience significant growth in the coming years, with the market expected to climb to over $23.3 billion by 2023. The financial sector has been one of the quickest to invest in blockchain, with over 60% of the technology’s market value concentrated in this field.The exciting similarity between blockchain and the internetAccording to recent research from Deutsche Bank, acceptance of the internet and of blockchain go almost hand in hand.The report from Deutsche Bank includes a graph that shows the starting points, middle points and projected forthcoming adoptions of both technologies. It clearly shows that both had a rough start during their initial years. However, after less than a decade in existence, internet adoption stood at around 500 million users. During the same timeframe, blockchain was used by approximately 50 million people. This ratio of 10 to 1 is clearly visible throughout the whole chart.Judging from the Deutsche Bank data, both indicators are set to quadruple in 10 years, with blockchain reaching 2,000 users and the internet reaching 200 million users.Overcoming stumbling blocks on the path toward crypto adoptionEstimates may vary, but we can say that as internet technology further progresses during the next decade, the distributed-ledger-technology industry will follow along. Perhaps not in leaps and bounds, but with steady, robust step-by-step increases.There are particular challenges on the path toward global adoption: legal, technical and regulatory. However, I see 2020 as the year when blockchain technology will finally encounter real trouble in the world of finance and technology, allowing for new commercialization cases to be built upon this basis. There are so many opportunities that can significantly boost crypto adoption to millions — if not billions — of people. The blockchain disruption of acquiring, remittance and corporate settlement will be the very driver that will provide a new, large-scale wave of crypto adoption.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Gregory Klumov is a stablecoin expert whose insights and opinions appear regularly in numerous international publications.

41977, TON Community: ‘No One Can Prevent the Launch of TON’ ,2020-03-26t15:06:00+00:00,4262,149,"Developers of the TON blockchain are still considering deployment, despite injunctive ruling by the U.S. court.Fedor Skuratov, a spokesperson for TON Community Foundation, a community of TON developers, told Cointelegraph that the recent unfavorable decisions by the U.S. court did not catch them by surprise:“The community was ready for this (or another) scenario. We have several options, including the launch of TON by TCF [TON Community Foundation]. I will say more, no one (no one) can prevent the launch of TON by any other entity, person or community, cause TON is a decentralized open-source solution. Already, there are two different test networks, and within the community, there is at least one group planning to launch.”“No One Can Prevent the Launch of TON”TCF believes that a fork of TON’s mainnet could bypass the SEC and the U.S. courts. By doing this, the blockchain would be legally decoupled from the original project. In the event of this occurring, original investors may have to settle for the assets issued on this forked network instead:“The issue of what will be recognized as the core network (Mainnet) is a matter of community recognition exclusively. We are considering, among other things, the option in which we will negotiate with TON investors on the topic of converting their rights to grams in the Telegram’s originally mentioned TON into rights for other grams.”At this point, it is not clear whether the proposed solution was approved by Telegram founder, Pavel Durov. Considering that the TON blockchain is an open-source project, however, his opinion may not even matter.The interview with Fedor Skuratov was conducted by a Cointelegraph contributor Stephen O’Neal."
41974, Binance Reveals the Secret Behind Its Cryptocurrency Futures Success ,2020-03-26t13:57:00+00:00,5019,102,"Aaron Gong, vice president of futures at major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, explained to Cointelegraph how the firm managed to become one of the top crypto futures trading platforms.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, Binance recently overtook BitMEX and became the second-largest platform in terms of 24-hour Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading volume. When asked whether he is surprised by such success, Gong said that the firm created the product with the plan of becoming the top Bitcoin futures trading platform:“We knew we would be there soon, and we made it in slightly more than 6 months’ time.”The reasons for Binance’s futures successAccording to Gong, the three primary reasons behind the success of Binance’s futures products are the low taker fees, new features and a large amount of altcoin pairs. He said that too many exchanges offer negative maker fees:“Too many other exchanges offer negative maker fees, where most orders are just computerized market makers competing for best bid and ask with extremely limited taker interest during periods of low-volatility.”Gong also said that innovation also drives trading volumes when it comes to Binance’s futures. He claimed that the exchange has had a few firsts when it comes to the crypto futures market:“We are the first major crypto exchange to launch max 125X leverage for BTC contracts, and the first of its kind to launch cross collateral and smart liquidation mechanism. These features have gained tremendous popularity amongst our users.”The third reason for the success of Binance’s futures contracts, Gong explained, is the number of altcoin contracts. He said that the firm launched 24 futures contracts on the platform, adding:“As of today, Binance Futures houses half of the top 10 most liquid altcoin contracts, many of which are also the most traded pairs amongst all futures exchanges.”Binance’s key to future successGong’s strategy to drive the volume of futures contracts on Binance is to continue bringing more functionalities and products to the industry. He said that he believes Binance has outdone its competitors, as other crypto trading platforms suffered problems such as overloads, poor risk management, and counterintuitive product designs. He explained that Binance’s design was largely driven by user’s complaints about other platforms:“We specifically aimed to address these issues and improve the users’ experience. As such, we put tremendous efforts to build an industry-leading matching engine that is able to process more than 100,000 orders per second. [...] Whilst there were issues of system overloads, outages, glitches, and even rollbacks elsewhere, we’ve proven time and again to be a safe, reliable, cheap and liquid venue for hedging.”It is worth noting that Binance’s trading platform ran into a number of issues in February. On Feb. 19, the exchange halted trading to resolve an unexpected technical issue with its infrastructure.As a Feb. 25 Cointelegraph analysis illustrated, this incident took place after a week in which the platform was often unresponsive to trader input as the exchange was unable to manage a large uptick in user volume.In early March, Binance halted trading again to fix a malfunction. The exchange’s co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao purportedly blocked Jay Hao — the CEO of competing exchange OKEx — on Twitter, after he publicly offered to help fix the infrastructure.However, Gong said that the malfunctions did not affect Binance’s futures trading infrastructure and that futures traders were not affected:“Our futures system has been proving to be performing well during the most volatile period since we launched. The futures market is running on a separate matching engine.”"
41970," Bitcoin Fares Well Against Fiat Currencies, but It’s in a Class of Its Own ",2020-03-26t13:19:00+00:00,2990,117,"Gone are the days of dusty ledgers and checkbooks. Over the last decade or so, the word “money” has taken on a completely new meaning for a lot of people all over the world. This is partly due to the masses being utterly frustrated with the way many big banks handle their business transactions.In fact, with the use of physical money on the decline, the market for digital payments has started to replace a whole host of traditionally popular banking avenues. To put things into perspective, in Asia alone, more than 1.4 billion individuals make use of China’s two biggest payment platforms to facilitate their daily transactions.Not only that, but with the rise of crypto, an increasing number of consumers all over the world have been afforded the opportunity to make their payments at thousands of retail outlets via the use of their digital holdings. However, with that out there, it is worth asking oneself the question, How do traditional currencies correlate with cryptocurrencies, and if they do, what are the key indicators that clearly point to these associations?Bitcoin as a currencyTo get a better understanding of the matter, Cointelegraph reached out to Gregory Klumov, the CEO of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Stasis. In his view, over the last 10 years of Bitcoin’s (BTC) lifecycle, the flagship crypto asset has exhibited short periods of correlation with risk assets such as equities and emerging-market currencies. He went on to add:“In the long run, I could not find any meaningful (>0.5) r-squared value comparing it to other assets. I believe that BTC will further continue to gain traction as a non-correlated asset, and become a genuine member of the liquid alternatives asset class.”Even though Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of the last decade, questions regarding its volatility have often been raised. To this point, Will Reeves, the CEO of Fold — a privacy-focused platform for crypto payments — told Cointelegraph that even though Bitcoin is perceived as being more volatile than most fiat currencies, the crypto asset is not subject to the same inevitability of inflation as the United States dollar, Russian ruble or the euro. Speaking on what truly sets Bitcoin apart from state-backed currencies, Reeves opined:“Governments are constantly printing more money, but bitcoin has a fixed supply (no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever exist). Scarcity creates demand, ensuring that bitcoin will tend to gain value over time, unlike fiat currencies whose long-term value tractories are more unpredictable.”A closer look at Bitcoin’s relationship with premier fiat currenciesUpon examination, it becomes clear that when Bitcoin is pitted against major players like the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Russian ruble, etc., the premier crypto coin’s meteoric rise shines forth quite clearly, as all the aforementioned currencies have faced repeated periods of long-term stagnation and economic collapse. In this regard, Bitcoin stands alone in its ability to recover beyond its past highs within short time windows, as has been exhibited time and again by the flagship asset.On the subject, Sky Guo, the CEO of Cypherium — an enterprise-focused blockchain platform — told Cointelegraph that he believes Bitcoin’s amazing comeback power lies solely with the fact that it makes use of a deflationary design model. Not only that, Guo also pointed out that Bitcoin stands alone in another, more abstract metric: its overall purchasing power. He explained:“Some experts misguidedly confuse price with purchasing power, i.e., they believe that a currency’s purchasing power is directly expressed by its USD value. In fact, Bitcoin’s purchasing power has risen as steadily as the dollars’ has fallen. Since the start of the 20th century, a single dollar’s impact on the material flow of goods and services in the world has steadily declined. Bitcoin’s impact on wealth and the flow of capital is becoming more powerful every day, as the engineers and entrepreneurs in our space continue to build out its spending infrastructure.”Providing his detailed insights on the matter, Gauthier Bros, the CEO of Atayen — a company providing web solutions across the fields of blockchain, big data and cloud computing — told Cointelegraph that while the purchasing power of most established fiat currencies may not appear to fluctuate wildly when looked at within a monthly time frame, on the scale of years and decades, individuals who invest heavily in fiat inevitably end up losing value in unprecedented proportions. He explained:“Everyone knows well that the value of $1 or €1 was worth much more in the 1990s than it is today. BTC is only a decade old, if on May 21, 2011, one could buy a pizza for 5000 BTC, today those same 5000 BTC are worth $30,000,000. Many savers who have bet on FIAT currencies would be very happy to have been able to take advantage of such an appreciation of their savings.”Finally, Eric Benz, CEO of the Changelly crypto-trading platform, told Cointelegraph that when he started deeply exploring the crypto domain at the turn of the last decade, Bitcoin was trading at around $1 per coin. However, between 2011 and 2018, the digital currency went on to showcase its true monetary worth, regardless of any comparisons to traditional assets. Benz further added:“I don’t really agree when Bitcoin is compared against fiat currencies. Bitcoin might act like money but it is far bigger than this, hence its value and volatility. Money is merely the first ‘app’ for Bitcoin and we have yet to witness how revolutionary this technology will be in changing many different industries. Fiat currencies all have to be more or less strong but as we have seen over the past decades, government-backed money is becoming more and more suspect and as a result, people have begun to really lose trust in it.”He then stated that in many of the world’s more volatile regions, local currencies are slowly losing significance as more people become increasingly dependent on the U.S. dollar. Benz also pointed out that due to Bitcoin’s scarcity — in that only a total 21 million coins will ever exist — the currency will become more valuable as time passes.Bitcoin’s volatility compared with traditional fiat assetsEven though there is a perception that traditional fiat assets like the dollar or the euro are not as volatile as crypto, it is worth remembering that volatility can only be truly measured when one is allowed to work with a minimum of two distinct assessment parameters, like the dollar being stacked up against Bitcoin.To better illustrate this point, Sidharth Sogani of Crebaco, a blockchain/crypto research and intelligence company, told Cointelegraph that the price of Bitcoin is conventionally considered to be volatile when talking in terms of the dollar alone. However, he proceeded to add:“One Bitcoin always remains one Bitcoin. Same thing is with other fiat currencies. But the problem is we don’t get to see the other parameter to measure the value of USD (as in we don’t know what is it backed by) since governments don’t disclose the other side. Hence we think one dollar is still one dollar in terms of its face value, not the actual value. The actual value is badly manipulated. Recently, trillions of dollars were pumped in due to the crash, where do you think they are getting all those dollars from?”On a somewhat related note, Nokenchain CEO Guillaume Thuillet told Cointelegraph that while fiat currencies tend to display low short-term volatility, this is simply due to the fact that if the money currently being circulated globally were to drop by 10% in value overnight, the results experienced worldwide would be catastrophic. Therefore, in essence, governments have to keep printing money and pumping it into their local economies to maintain a status quo for markets all over the world to remain relatively stable.Finally, Jasper Tay, the chief operating officer at Plutus — a crypto debit card provider — commented on the volatility aspect of Bitcoin. He told Cointelegraph that people shouldn’t be looking for correlations between Bitcoin and other fiat currencies, but should rather compare the crypto asset with stock market indices. “The market needs to realize there is an opportunity to trade into a decentralized asset when we are on the cusp of another credit crisis and depression,” he said.Tay also opined that while Bitcoin is widely recognized as a volatile asset, investors need to bear in mind that this market still has a relatively low number of participants when compared to most fiat-driven sectors, which results in less liquidity and faster price jumps.Why do people still trust the traditional banking sector?For more than a century, people all over the world have been taught in their schools and universities that a slight degree of inflation is always necessary for economic growth. However, this very inflation results in what could be referred to as a recession every decade or so.Even though the global value of different economies across the planet might have increased a hundredfold over the past century alone, what this basically points toward is that a bigger financial bubble is being created behind the scenes. Elaborating his thoughts on this matter, Sogani added:“These bubbles have now caught the attention and people are more aware of how manipulation is being done by central banks. Bitcoin is deflationary or a stagnant system. as there is no new printing of BTC. The Alfred Marshall (father of economics) is yet to be born for the decentralized world. Very soon this economic aspect of the Bitcoin-led economy will be recognized.”On the same subject, Benz explained that people still trust the system in place because it is all they have ever known. In addition to this, he pointed out that there is a clear lack of educated individuals who are aware of the differences between government-backed fiat currencies and crypto.Paolo Ardonio, the chief technology officer of Bitfinex and Tether, also commented on this topic, telling Cointelegraph that the situation the world is currently facing has validated what the crypto industry has been building to over the past 10 years. He added that the global economy needs transparency and blockchain now more than ever: “You can’t keep printing money out of thin air leaving our children to pick up the debt. Bitcoin is the answer.”Lastly, Bros added lightheartedly that whether it’s the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, most centralized financial entities don’t seem to find obstacles to their favorite pastime: printing more money. He also added that this very act of creating more cash out of thin air is the basis of all financial bubbles and continues to give a lot of people the confidence they currently have in their existing monetary systems. He pointed out:“Thanks to their dollars, people can fill up their shopping trolleys, the petrol tank of their car. They cannot do this directly with Bitcoin, it is this capacity of FIAT that gives them their confidence. If tomorrow, and this will be the case, the masses find themselves extorting from their savings ([i.e.,] war effort against coronavirus), that their money no longer allows them to consume as before, they will turn to a system that does not allow this kind of excess, BTC will then make sense.”Looking aheadFrom a historical standpoint, a vast majority of traditional fiat assets have enjoyed extended durations of capital deployment from established institutions that provide their value with a stable anchor. However, the problem here is that institutional capital tends to reduce the volatility of an asset by running arbitrage and derivatives strategies.Being a very young asset, Bitcoin still lacks the same volume of institutional capital participation, which is why it still fluctuates quite wildly. However, with the masses now slowly beginning to realize the limitations of the legacy financial system, it would not be surprising to see the aforementioned scenario change in the coming few years."

The firm worked alongside the Foundation throughout the process and compiled the final version of the report on March 6.Ethereum Foundation commissions Least Authority to audit ETH 2.0The security firm reviewed the core ETH 2.0 specs for phase 0, the Beacon Chain specs, and Beacon Chain Fork Choice documents, peer-to-peer (P2P) networking documentation, the Honest Validator specifications, and the documentation for the Go Implementation of ETH 2.0.The report notes that while specific aspects of ETH 2.0’s design can be reviewed, “the collective system may not behave as intended.”Report highlights risks to block proposersWhile the report found the ETH 2.0 specs to be “very well thought out and comprehensive,” noting that “security had been a strong consideration during the design phase,” Least Authority highlights concerns regarding the P2P layer and risks to block proposers.The researchers assert that the network specifications make it a fairly easy task for block validators to establish the IP addresses of other validators.With the documentation implying block proposers are public knowledge, the firm is concerned that an attacker may seek to strategically execute denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.The report also warns that an attacker could wield a large volume of nodes to launch a targeted attack on block proposers.Least Authority notes concerns regarding P2P networking protocolThe security firm asserts that the documentation surrounding ETH 2.0’s P2P and Ethereum node records (ENR) systems is lacking, emphasizing that they were “unable to conclude how the P2P system incorporates the ENR system.”A “spam problem” is also identified in the protocol’s P2P messaging system. The report warns that the absence of a centralized entity overseeing nodes' actions opens up the possibility of a dishonest node attempting to overwhelm the network with an unlimited number of old block messages while incurring little penalty.“This type of attack would slow down or potentially halt network processing for the duration it was carried out,” the findings conclude.The report also highlights concerns regarding “misaligned gossip incentives” and the lack of “BAR-resilient gossip protocol,” and urges the Ethereum foundation to seek regular peer reviews of its code.Of the 10 issues identified in the firm’s final report, two have since been resolved, and one has been determined to have been an invalid issue.Security vulnerability identified among Ethereum Dapp walletsOn March 23, crypto wallet provider ZenGO announced it had built a testnet to highlight a major security flaw pervading decentralized applications (Dapp) wallets — urging wallet providers to make users aware of the vulnerability.ZenGo’s testnet demonstrates how through authorizing a single transaction between a user’s wallet and a Dapp’s smart contract grants the application authorization to access all funds held within that wallet."

To get a bullish view for XRP, the previous support at 0.00002500-0.00002575 needs to be reclaimed as support. However, that’s not entirely making the movements of XRP bullish.The next step to make a bullish perspective for XRP would be to make a higher high above 0.00003365 satoshis.

Source: TradingViewThe USD chart of XRP is showing a clear downwards moving trend. The price of XRP is resting on the final support at $0.145, which is crucial. If the price of XRP drops below the $0.145 level, a further downwards drop is likely to occur. Traders should target $0.06 as the next support level in that case.Such a downwards would be combined by a deep drop on the BTC pair, as discussed previously. However, such a drop would also be caused due to weakness in the cryptomarkets in general.The price movements are comparable to the movements in the previous cycle, as the price of XRP retraced back to the support level prior to the deep surge in the last cycle too.

Yes, there are some movements needed to create some bullish momentum.First of all, the price needs to hold the $0.145 level for support, after which the resistances at $0.182 and $0.20 needs to be cleared to the upside. The moment that XRP reclaims the previous support at $0.20 for support, then there’s a possibility that the price continues to rally towards $0.30-0.33 as the next resistance.Such a move would confirm that XRP was copying the movements of the previous crypto cycle in 2014-2016. In that cycle, the price of XRP fully retraced the bull move, after which a sideways accumulation period of one year occurred. If the price of XRP moves to $0.32 in the coming months, a similar period of sideways accumulation should be expected.For further bullish momentum and sentiment, the price should make a new higher high. In that case, the price of XRP needs to move above $0.33 to create one.However, if $0.145 is lost as support, a drop towards $0.06 is on the tables and can be expected.BTC pair needs to reclaim 0.000025 satoshis as supportXRP BTC 1-day chart.

41965, European Commission Calls on Blockchain Devs for Defense-Focused Solutions ,2020-03-26t12:02:00+00:00,2419,125,"The European Commission (EC) is offering grants to blockchain developers and other specialists for solutions that adapt technologies from civil to defense applications.On March 24, the EC published a European Defense Industrial Development Program tender calling on small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to propose rapid, cost-effective solutions — focused on new approaches and proposals for technologies or concepts that have previously not been applied to the defense sector.Combinations of blockchain with “digital twins” for logistics purposesAs regards blockchain, the EC provides an outline to guide applications to the program, which stand to benefit from its 2019-20 254 million euro budget for grants, if successful. Specifically, the EC seeks proposals that are:“Based on real-time cloud and on-premise digital twin benefiting from blockchain technologies’ robustness, able to channel all currently optimized logistics needs, such as chain of spare parts, maintenance, energy consumables.”A digital twin is the virtual representation or mirror of any physical entity, asset or process — whether a machine, object, piece of infrastructure or human being. The field of blockchain can strengthen the integrity of digital twins by, for example, allowing for the use of tamper-proof cryptographic tags that validate the provenance, state and ownership of products or objects.As noted in a Deloitte 2018 report, combining digital twins with blockchain can offer particular benefits for sectors such as the internet of things, which can be used, among other applications, for predictive maintenance in production environments.Deloitte outlines that blockchain can be useful to provide secure identity management, transparent ownership models and efficient data analytics, all of which can enhance the flexibility and resilience of various systems.As can be seen from the above guidance, the EC recognizes the potential of combining blockchain with digital twins for diverse defense-critical sectors such as supply chains, equipment maintenance and energy.Submissions to the program are open from April 15, with a provisional deadline of Dec. 1, 2020, depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.Blockchain in the defense sectorAs recently reported, BAE Systems — a United States-based contractor that provides support and service solutions for defense, intelligence, and civilian systems — listed an open position for so-called “cryptocurrency exploiters” to support its operations last month.In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense released its own plans for blockchain technology in its four-year roadmap for digital modernization."
41962, Physical Delivery of Bitcoin in Bakkt Futures Rises 44% in March ,2020-03-26t11:15:00+00:00,4760,149,"Physical delivery of Bitcoin (BTC) for futures on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)’s Bakkt platform is going strong, despite a tumultuous month for the markets.Data from Arcane Research posted on March 26 reveals that, as of March 20, the number of traders opting to receive physical delivery of the cryptocurrency rose 44% on the month.Bakkt delivery of Bitcoin, Oct. 2019- March 2020. Source: @ArcaneResearchPhysical vs. cash settlementBakkt’s Bitcoin futures contracts — the first of their kind to be physically settled in Bitcoin — first went live in September 2019. At the time, many commentators stated that physically-delivered Bitcoin futures trading, which gives traders direct exposure to the asset, would represent a leap forward for the institutional acceptance of the coin.Notably, while physical delivery of Bitcoin upon contract expiry has significantly increased, other metrics for Bakkt in March — the volume of traded contracts and open interest — are both significantly down.According to tracking data compiled by Twitter account Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot) — which is not affiliated with Bakkt but rather with the Dutch journalist and crypto author Gert-Jan Lasterie — the volume of traded contracts on Bakkt on March 25 was at 1,161 ($7.73 million), down from an all-time high of 6,601 on Dec. 18, 2019. Open interest was at $4.16 million.“Paper trading”As global markets analyst and trader Alex Krüger has previously noted, the number of traders opting for physical delivery had been underwhelming in the first months since the Bakkt contract’s launch. In late November 2019, he said:“Bakkt has bitcoin bulls excited. Volume is growing exponentially. From a low base, but growing fast nonetheless. But what makes Bakkt special for bulls is not its volume, but how many bitcoins are physically delivered. In November, the number was 17 bitcoins. In October, 15.”In a subsequent tweet, Krüger argued that in fall 2019, Bakkt activity was “not that different from the CME. It is almost entirely paper trading” — a reference to the cash-settled Bitcoin futures on CME, which first launched back in winter 2017.By December 2019, Krüger was observing that “almost nobody takes physical delivery,” adding: “this is not a problem. It is normal for futures traders to not take delivery, in all assets. But Bakkt is no panacea.”The alternatives to physical delivery are choosing to roll over a contract, prolonging price speculation on the underlying asset.In the case of CME’s cash-settled Bitcoin futures, their trading has historically drawn suspicion, with some claiming that Bitcoin’s price is vulnerable to manipulation in advance of contract settlements.In December 2019, Bakkt officially confirmed its own launch of a cash-settled Bitcoin futures contract via ICE Futures Singapore."

41960, Bitcoin Hash Rate Drops Almost 45% Since 2020 Peak ,2020-03-26t09:27:00+00:00,21907,187,"The Bitcoin (BTC) network hash rate has just taken a steep plummet and is now down almost 45% from its 2020 peak.The network’s hash rate sank from 136.2 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) on March 1 to 75.7 EH/s today, March 26, according to data from Blockchain.com.Coin.dance — another analytics site for the coin’s blockchain — reveals a similar pattern, if less stark. The site reported a 2020 peak of roughly 150 EH/s on March 5, today down to 105.6 EH/s — a 29% decrease.Bitcoin network hash rate, April 19, 2019–March 27, 2020, Source: blockchain.comHash rate and difficultyThe hash rate of a cryptocurrency is a parameter that gives the measure of the number of calculations that a given network can perform each second.A higher hash rate means greater competition among miners to validate new blocks; it also increases the number of resources needed for performing a 51% attack, making the network more secure.After a volatile month in which Bitcoin saw dramatic, if short-lived, losses of as high as 60% to around $3,600 in mid-March, the network’s difficulty yesterday decreased by close to 16%.Difficulty — or how challenging it is computationally to solve and validate a block on the blockchain — is set to adjust every 2016 blocks, or two weeks, in order to maintain a consistent ~10-minute block verification time.This has a close connection to the network’s hash rate. Typically, when the network sees a low level of participating mining power, the difficulty will tumble — while in periods of intense network participation, it rises, working as a counterbalancing mechanism.As reported yesterday, the last downward adjustment in difficulty was on February 25 of this year, when the coin’s price was around $9,900. Just three days later, it dropped to around $8,800, and by March 14, to nearly $4,800 — and as low as $3,600 on some exchanges, as noted above.Interpreting the dataTheis relationship between price, hash rate, and difficulty has historically generated a trend that some analysts refer to as a “miners’ capitulation cycle.”The theory holds that while Bitcoin’s price remains high, and mining is profitable, both hash rate and difficulty inch upwards until they reach a threshold at which miners are squeezed and forced to liquidate more and more of their holdings to cover their expenses — leading to an increased supply of Bitcoin on the market.The “capitulation point” — at which some can no longer afford to keep mining altogether — then involves a decline in hash rate (reflecting lower participation) — as can be seen today — and a subsequent reset in the network’s difficulty.According to data from btc.com, Bitcoin’s difficulty is currently forecast to decrease by a further 16% in 14 days’ time."
41958, Prosecutor Says Crypto Scammers Should Stay in Jail Despite COVID-19 Concerns ,2020-03-26t09:06:00+00:00,2191,67,"New Jersey federal prosecutor Craig Carpenito is fighting the request of two alleged crypto scammers to be released from a county jail amid the coronavirus pandemic.According to court documents filed with the United States Department of Justice on March 24, Carpenito asserted that the recently enacted Bail Reform only preferences pretrial release of a defendant when their appearance at trial could be reasonably assured.Carpenito noted that COVID-19 has sparked a “national conversation” regarding whether pretrial detainees accused of nonviolent crimes should be released, in order to reduce the risk of coronavirus rapidly spreading in U.S. jails.However, he emphasized that Matthew Goettsche and Jobadiah Weeks — both accused of the $722 million BitClub Network cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme — have “strong incentives” to flee:""The facts that compelled their detention have not changed — they maintain, among other things, unaccounted for wealth, overseas contacts, and strong incentives to flee. Although the pandemic has curtailed international commercial air travel, there remain numerous flights out of the country.""Defendants worry about COVID-19 outbreak in county jailGoettsche and Weeks filed motions petitioning the Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark, New Jersey for their release on March 20 and 23, respectively.Goettsche’s representation asserted that “it is not a matter of ‘if’, but ‘when’” the jail hosts a serious COVID-19 outbreak, adding that “it will be nearly impossible to stop its spread” once the virus reaches the facility.Weeks’ attorney argued that the jail has “an exceptionally poor record maintaining detainee health,” citing a U.S Department of Homeland Security report that identified numerous food safety issues and “leaks causing mold and mildew growth in every housing unit holding detainees.”Goettsche and Weeks comprise flight risksDespite their attorneys’ claims of health and safety concerns, Carpenito emphasizes that the pair “are not elderly and, with the exception of Weeks' asthma condition, which apparently has moderated in adulthood, they do not present with health conditions that make them particularly susceptible to COVID-19 complication.”The prosecutor cited the determinations of Judge Michael Hammer following a previous detention hearing, who noted that both men had access to assets that could “fund a risk of flight.”Carpentino added that the pair had failed to present a “compelling reason” for their release."
41957, This Is Our Last Chance to Protect Our Privacy Amid the COVID-19 Crisis ,2020-03-26t08:54:00+00:00,4377,193,"As the coronavirus continues to spread a total lockdown across the world, governments are creating the foundations for a new society of total surveillance. Can we stop the global pandemic without sacrificing our freedom? I believe we can, but the technology we deploy today should preserve privacy, not destroy our liberties due to global panic.Suspending fundamental rights during a crisis may seem comforting, but historically, the declaration of a state of emergency without end leads to new forms of fascism. Yet, from the Chinese censorship of doctors during its COVID-19 outbreak to the absurd lack of preparedness for a pandemic in the United States, it is precisely the government’s lack of preparation over the years that has exacerbated the catastrophe.When governments seize emergency powers, they never give them up. Under the pretext of monitoring and tracking the spread of the disease, government mass surveillance via mobile phone tracking risks becoming normalized. Algorithmic bias now goes beyond academic studies as opaque algorithms can and will decide who can travel and work in places like China, and will no doubt soon decide who lives and who dies from the virus. Is this the world we want our children to inherit?The window for deploying technology to preserve privacy is drawing to a close. More than ever, we need technologies that harness the collective intelligence of humanity to tackle the COVID-19 crisis without sacrificing our freedom.Mass surveillance is only going to get worse after coronavirusJust as modern computing came out of World War II and the internet was developed from the Cold War, the coronavirus could lead to a new technological revolution. But rather than the biomedical revolution that is needed to actually cure COVID-19, what we have seen is a focus on tracing those infected, even when medical experts note that this is likely too late to be effective in Europe and the U.S.In China, public monitoring is nothing new, but experts believe the virus has given the government an opportunity to increase surveillance as citizens install self-monitoring apps for their own good. Facial recognition technology is being used to detect heightened temperatures or raise concerns about civilians without protective masks — and there’s no sign of this technology disappearing when, or if, the pandemic does.Iran has taken advantage of the crisis by trying to get its citizens to install spyware on their phones that directly reports their whereabouts to the government. In Israel, authorities have gone further by announcing that the General Security Service — the country’s domestic intelligence agency — will track Israelis who contract the virus via their mobile phone data, performing “one of the most comprehensive national surveillance exercises anywhere in the world.”Similarly to how 9/11 led to the National Security Agency legalizing the tracking of civilian data, COVID-19 has provided an all-too-convenient post-terrorism excuse for expanding surveillance in the United States, including via cooperation with Google, Microsoft, IBM and the rest.While everyone is distracted by the coronavirus, the U.S. government is trying to make the mass capture of messages mandatory via backdooring the end-to-end encryption on client devices by sneaking the EARN IT act through Congress. Some journalists are claiming breaking encryption is even needed to stop the spread of misinformation about coronavirus, despite the fact that most mainstream press in the United States thought “the coronavirus is less dangerous than the flu” just a few weeks ago.Technology can save us — without Big BrotherWe seem damned if we don’t collect the data needed to stop the coronavirus, and damned if we build a mass surveillance apparatus to do so. Is there any way out?There is a way out of this paradox — we need to build the technology using privacy by design. For over two decades, cryptographers, lawyers and activists have been advocating for decentralized and privacy-enhanced technologies that give us all the benefits of collecting personal data, but keeping our data private.As professor Alex “Sandy” Pentland of MIT said, “We want answers, not data.” When will the coronavirus peak? Are my friends and family going to be infected? How can we save the most lives? This requires computing on data, but this data can be protected using tools from distributed computing, cryptography and even blockchain technology.Unfortunately, funding for privacy-enhancing technology from the public sector is virtually nonexistent, just like the funding for a pandemic response. Venture capital in Silicon Valley hasn’t really stepped up yet to fund startups working on privacy. After all, it’s much easier to make a profit by just collecting all the data without any precautions to defend our civil liberties.There are reasons to be hopeful. Techniques like differential privacy that add “noise” to data provably obscure identity in a database — already have been shown to work by Apple, Google and others.The government of Singapore is setting a good example: The TraceTogether app for contact tracing does the right thing by keeping sensitive data on the user’s device, rather than trying to gather the data en-masse from cell phone carriers.Yet building privacy-enhanced technology is just more expensive, just as it’s also more expensive to build bridges that don’t collapse or create COVID-19 tests that actually work.Stopping surveillance by empowering peopleIt’s time to release our instinct for human solidarity and mutual aid that can actually cure COVID-19. Everything from designs to parts of low-cost,open-source respirators to 3D-printed face masks that are already in production are signs of what is possible, and the race for a vaccine is on.Similar to how Bitcoin (BTC) solves hash puzzles, one inspiring effort is Folding@home’s effort to use computational cycles of home computer users to simulate “potentially druggable protein targets from SARS-CoV2” in order to find a cure.We decided to apply these “people power”-based solutions to stopping mass surveillance. Rather than mining like Bitcoin, Nym harnesses computational cycles of volunteers from all over the world to mix users’ internet packets with those of other people — so their traffic can be anonymous in a crowd. Called a mixnet, this kind of design can defend privacy even against adversaries as powerful as the NSA that can watch the entire network, unlike Tor and VPNs.With remote working due to coronavirus is exposing companies to greater information security risk, more and more of us are using VPNs at home. However, VPNs only encrypt traffic to another computer and do nothing to prevent mass surveillance, as a VPN just puts all user trust in another computer that can easily hand user data over to the government. In order to prevent this central point of failure, we suggest using blockchain technology to coordinate a decentralized and global network to prevent mass surveillance and ensure free speech and civil liberties.Even the Roman empire collapsed when faced with massive plagues, and the coronavirus may spell the end of the post-Soviet neoliberal world order. If there’s any chance of getting out of this alive, it’s not because our governments saved us with mass surveillance — it’s because we saved ourselves with the internet-enabled collective intelligence of humanity. Supporting privacy tech gives us that chance, without responding to COVID-19 like it’s a dress rehearsal for making Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four a reality.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Harry Halpin is the co-founder and CEO of Nym Technologies.

41955, Report: Crypto Investment Wealth Is Highest in San Francisco Bay Area ,2020-03-26t07:40:00+00:00,2699,129,"Crypto taxation tool CoinTracker has released a report comparing the prevalence of cryptocurrency ownership across major cities in the United States. The report is based on user data that CoinTracker has been collecting since 2013.CoinTracker found that the top four ranked cities by average crypto portfolio size are all in California’s San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco proper at approximately $55,000 followed by Palo Alto with $39,000, Oakland with $35,000 and San Mateo with $30,600.Only four cities outside of California are home to investors whose average crypto holdings exceed $20,000 in the U.S. — with Seattle, New York, Tampa, and Pittsburgh investors holding between $27,000 and $21,000 on average.Concentration of investorsThe findings also show a significant concentration of crypto investors in the cities of San Francisco and New York — with their combined “crypto user index” roughly equating to that of the next four highest-ranked cities combined.San Francisco is the top U.S. crypto city by the number of investors and thus scored a user index of 100.New York ranks second for crypto investor density with a user index rating of 92, however, it ranks sixth by the average value of holdings at nearly $23,000.Los Angeles has the third-largest density of crypto investors with a user index of 57.2, followed by Chicago with 48.8, and Seattle with 39.7.Ashburn, Virginia tops per capita crypto holder rankingsDespite comprising a small town of 43,000 in Virginia, Ashburn tops the list for crypto ownership density when assessed on a per capita basis.Despite its small population, Ashburn has been described as the “Center of the Internet,” with 70% of internet traffic passing through the city that also has the fourth-largest data center density in the United States.Washington’s Redmond, a city outside of Seattle and the “bicycle capital of the northwest,” has the second-highest number of crypto investors per capita, followed by San Francisco.79% of U.S. crypto wealth is held in Bitcoin or EtherBitcoin (BTC) investments comprise 50.3% of CoinTracker users’ crypto portfolios, followed by Ether (ETH) at 28.7%.Tether (USDT) ranks third at4.1%, followed by Litecoin (LTC) at 3.3%, Ripple (XRP) at 3.1%, Chainlink (LINK) at1.9%, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Tezos (XTZ) with 1.7% each.The eight-most popular crypto assets comprise 94.8% of U.S. virtual currency holdings combined, with all other crypto assets representing less than 1% of total capital in the cryptocurrency markets each.Ether investments outweigh the Bitcoin holdings of investors in San Diego, Nashville, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and The Bronx — with Ether comprising more than 50% of crypto wealth in each city.Investors based in Redmond, San Antonio, Atlanta, and Fremont have the majority of their crypto capital allocated to markets other than BTC or ETH."
41951, Kraken Predicts Wealth Transfer will Cause BTC Rise to $350K by 2045 ,2020-03-26t06:34:00+00:00,12039,238,"Millennials and Generation Xers in the United States currently practicing sheltering in place and social distancing may find some solace that — in addition to saving lives — they may stand to inherit almost $70 trillion from Baby Boomers in the years to come.Kraken Intelligence, the in-house research team at the crypto exchange of the same name, released a new report entitled “Inheriting USDs & Acquiring BTCs: How ‘The Great Wealth Transfer’ Will Fuel ‘The Great Bitcoin Adoption.’”According to the report, if American Millennials were to invest at least five percent of their inherited wealth into Bitcoin (BTC), they could drive the price up to $350,000 in 2044. This would effectively give the generational group almost $70 trillion of value from a $971 billion investment.3/ Here’s a projection showing the estimated flow of assets as the Baby Boom generation declines and transfers its wealth to Gen X and Millennials.Almost 70% of the total $70 trillion transfer will occur in the next 10 years. pic.twitter.com/zXpZf17NBB— Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) March 25, 2020A generational approach to investmentsAs Bitcoin has gained popularity, those in older generations with an affinity for traditional assets — including Warren Buffett — have often been unwilling to embrace cryptocurrency.The Kraken report looks at data on this divide, expanding on cultural profiles of Generation Xers and Millennials and how their upbringing has affected their view of BTC and the crypto market in general.“...older generations possessed a less favorable view of bitcoin than Millennials and Gen Xers.... 81% of US adults were familiar with at least one type of cryptocurrency, bitcoin being the most popular at 75%, approximately 55% of Millennials and 41% of Generation X familiar with at least one cryptocurrency voiced their belief that cryptocurrencies will become ‘very’ or ‘somewhat’ widely accepted for legal transactions before 2030.”With many older Americans on the verge of retirement, the report suggests those in younger generations who are not only more familiar with but more accepting of Bitcoin will have more options investing in the future.“...a disproportionate percentage of the Millennials and Gen X will continue to be the driving force of adoption [of cryptocurrency] for the foreseeable future. While this can be explained in part by the fact that both generations harness a greater technological competence than their elders, we should also consider that bitcoin’s current volatility is unsuitable for individuals nearing or in retirement.”The Great Wealth TransferBaby Boomers in the United States currently control approximately 57% of the total wealth, $50 trillion of which will pass to Millennials and Gen Xers in the next two years. This redistribution is referred to as the “Great Wealth Transfer”.If younger people were to use just 1% of this wealth to then invest in BTC, the price could rise to $70,000 — if not more — in 2044. This is based only on investors in the U.S., meaning the actual numbers could easily be higher.Being one of the most crypto-friendly generations certainly has its perks."

The two firms are affiliated with each other and primarily operate in Switzerland and Denmark.Crypto scammers target victims on FacebookSenior MSC investigator Jason Roy stated that the victim was lured by a Facebook ad for Jbcapitals:“The company, Jbcapitals claimed to invest in Bitcoin/cryptocurrency markets on behalf of their clients with an ‘85% success rate’, but the victim was never able to recover any of his initial investment or supposed returns.”The MSC warns investors to look out for red flags that suggest fraud. These include the promise of high returns or insider information, and often apply pressure on investors to make decisions quickly.Police warn Manitobans of scams involving Bitcoin ATMsOn March 17, the Winnipeg Police Service published an article through the Winnipeg Free Press warning that a large number of Manitobans have fallen victims to scams “where fraudsters are having victims send them money in the form of Bitcoin.”The scams are executed under a variety of pretexts, such as fake romantic liaisons or job opportunities, with victims often directed to transfer BTC via Bitcoin ATMs.The police have urged Manitobans not to transfer funds to individuals they have not met in person or to pay “government utility bills” using a Bitcoin ATM."
41947, Japanese Investors Rushed To Buy The Dip After Bitcoin Bloodbath ,2020-03-26t04:32:00+00:00,5249,105,"The number of retail investors registering for an account with Japanese cryptocurrency exchange bitbank spiked by 40% in the week after the Bitcoin bloodbath.The March 12 meltdown saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) drop to a new 2020 low at $3,775. An official blog post by bitbank market analyst Yuya Hasegawa reveals that Bitcoin trade volume and account registrations both saw a significant surge in the wake of the crash.Even the number of users going through KYC was above average on the day of the BTC downturn and the following couple of days.Hasegawa contrasts the current situation to the period between November to December 2018 when the price of Bitcoin ground down. In that case, “interest in the crypto market as a whole went down and bitbank’s daily account registrations took a hit.”However, the price saw a 60% rebound while sustaining high volumes soon after the recent crash, which suggests to Hasegawa “the intent to buy the dip is quite obvious”:“When we take the increased daily account registrations into consideration, we can once again deduce that the current market recovery is driven largely by retail investors. Furthermore, as Forbes reports, this phenomenon is likely to be global, as Kraken, a San Francisco-based crypto exchange, experienced a steep increase in account registrations after March 12.”Bitcoin halving makes it a safe betIn just under 49 days, BTC will experience a halving where the block reward will decrease to 6.25 BTC. The last time this happened was in 2016.Hasegawa writes that data from Google Trends suggests that investors in Japan and around the world are well aware of the possible price impact of the halving and will seize on any price drop to add to their holdings:“There is a good chance that, for this time around, there are many retail investors who want to buy Bitcoin or stack up their holdings at the cheapest price possible before its halving.”"
41946, Malaysian Blockchain App Allows Users to Trace Sustainable Palm Oil ,2020-03-26t03:18:00+00:00,4466,129,"The Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) and blockchain startup BloomBloc have developed a blockchain app that enables users to trace palm oil throughout the entire supply chain.Following a successful test, the blockchain-based system is available in a pilot roll out to local oil palm growers, palm oil processors, plantations and family owned smallholders, according to food industry publication Foodbev Media. The system registers each tree and its associated information, making it possible for users to track the journey from plantation, to mill, and on to the final product.The new app follows on from the implementation of the mandatory Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification standard nationwide. MPOC CEO Datuk Dr Kalyana Sundram said:“It speaks volumes about our trust in our supply chain. And it is yet another way Malaysia is showing the world that we value our people and our planet. We hope that by creating this platform and demonstrating the benefits of using blockchain technology, we will encourage others who are practising sustainable agriculture to follow our lead.”To eradicate deforestationSustainability within the oil palm industry is a big issue in Malaysia due to illegal logging and the replacement of forests with plantations. According to environmental groups, palm oil producer Radiant Lagoon was responsible for the destruction of 730 ha of forest in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. The company is reportedly associated with Double Dynasty, a supplier of palm oil to manufacturers like Nestlé, Unilever, Mondelēz and P&G.But the government is fighting back. It has introduced more than 60 regulations and aims to improve forest management practices, as well as promoting various activities towards zero deforestation.The industry argues that the total planted area of oil palms in the country is 5.74 million ha. This equates to just 0.11 percent of global agricultural land but is responsible for 20% of global fats and oils exports.Malaysia actively deploys blockchainIt is not the first time Malaysia turned to blockchain tech in the food and agricultural products supply chain. Last year, the Malaysian state of Penang said it was considering using blockchain to trace the origins of products, which would also enable it to warn consumers about outbreaks of dangerous foodborne diseases.The education sector has also embraced the tech with the Malaysian Ministry of Education introducing an application built on the NEM blockchain to deal with the issue of certificate fraud.Malaysia has also launched a work visa program targeting tech freelancers that addresses a demand for blockchain capable talents."
41944," Maker Decentralizes Governance, But is the Community Ready? ",2020-03-26t02:32:00+00:00,1517,83,"The Maker Foundation has handed governance over the smart contract that underpins the MakerDAO (MKR) protocol to MKR token holders.Describing the move as the project’s “most significant step” toward decentralized governance, the foundation announced that a three month long transition of power to the community had been finalized. “The MKR token contract is now 100% in control of MKR holders,” the foundation said.The foundation urged the Maker community to “remain deeply engaged and continue to vote smartly and often”, warning that “voter apathy” could threaten the project:“While voter apathy can threaten any election process, it can do harm to a project’s decentralization efforts. Without enough community passion and well-intentioned participation, a community-governed system can become vulnerable and struggle to succeed.”In an earlier blog post on March 12, the Maker Foundation noted that greater participation in its debt collateral auctions could have stabilized the protocol and prevented MakerDAO’s recent $4.5 million under-collateralization.Maker completes three-month contract handoverFollowing the launch of its Multi-Collateral Dai protocol, MakerDAO announced that control over MKR tokens would be passed from the foundation to the protocol's smart contract on December 20. The foundation noted that it would share control over the contract for at least one month to ensure a successful handover.On January 10, the foundation deployed its ‘MkrAuthority’ contract on the Ethereum mainnet. Three days later, the foundation set the MKR token’s authority address to that of the MkrAuthority. On March 25, full permissions were granted over the MKR token to the MkrAuthority contract.As such, the MkrAuthority contract can create or destroy MKR through controlling Maker’s debt auction, and surplus auction, smart contracts. MkrAuthority has also been granted access to the burner contract and governance contract.The chief executive of the Maker Foundation, Rule Christensen said “complete” decentralization was on its way:“Today’s news is momentous. By completing its commitment to transfer the MKR token contract to MKR holders, the Maker Foundation continues to move toward a completely self-sustaining MakerDAO. And it’s just the beginning. We will continue to ready the community for complete decentralization in the weeks and months ahead.”MakerDAO debt auction covers $4.3 million in debtMaker’s governance handover follows the project’s first-ever debt auction — which saw $4.3 million in under-collateralized debt wiped from its books.MakerDAO is the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that governs the supply of the stablecoin Dai (DAI) — which are minted when users enter a collateralized debt position, often backed by Ethereum (ETH).With the recent crypto market crash causing the price of ETH to plummet over 50% in less than 48 hours, $4.5 million worth of these loans suddenly became under-collateralized — triggering the debt auction.The auctions saw 86 batches of MKR minted and sold in exchange for ‘lots’ of 50,000 DAI for an average price of $240 per token."
41940, Stage One of ‘Risky’ EOS Worker Proposal System Approved ,2020-03-26t01:08:00+00:00,2459,67,"Block producers have approved the first stage of the implementation of a controversial EOS governance change that allows any user to propose network rule changes.EOS blockchain explorer Bloks shows that the first phase was approved on March 24. EOS Nation — the block producer (BP) who proposed the system — claimed in a recent tweet that the 34 positive votes by BPs on the proposal is “the strongest consensus reached on any EOS Mainnet proposal”.According to an EOS Nation’s March 18 post, the newly approved Worker Proposal System (WPS) is a funding mechanism for the EOS mainnet meant to enable developers and other network’s value creators to seek funding. The system is inspired by Dash’s (DASH) Budget Proposal System.The voting and distribution mechanism is determined on-chain in WPS’s smart contracts and allows any EOS account to propose a budget for its project so BPs can vote on it. Each proposal that passes is paid directly from WPS’s eosio.wps account.Funding from EOS name auctionsEOS Nation CEO and founder Yves La Rose explained to Cointegraph that the approval was for the creation of the eosio.wps account, but added this was only the first of four stages of implementation. The second stage will be the approval by BPs of a transfer of 50,000 EOS from the eosio.names account — which holds the proceedings from EOS’s premium names auctions — to the WPS account. La Rose explained:“On EOS the account names are 12 characters long (A to Z, 1 to 5) - but there's a built-in auction system for ‘premium name’ that are shorter. [...] The administrative funds collected through this auction (the successful bids) go to the eosio.names account. [...] These are the funds that will be used in the WPS.”Will the system be fully deployed? ProbablyThe third phase deploys the smart contract managing the WPS system to the eos.io.wps account. The fourth — and last — stage of implementation is the initialization of the new system. When Cointelegraph asked La Rose whether it is safe to assume that the system will eventually be deployed, he answered:“No. I mean, it looks as though that is where we are heading, but until the contracts are deployed [...] then it's still open for debate. [...] It would seem that there is indeed positive intent on getting this launched. However, as I often say – it means nothing until it's on chain.”Block.One CEO says it’s riskyCointelegraph recently reported that Brendan Blumer, the CEO and co-founder of Block.One — the firm behind the EOSIO software that the EOS chain runs — expressed concern over the proposal. In a March 15 tweet, he said:“Even if the amount is nominal, socially authorising the BP’s to direct token-holder funds into projects without a clear or measurable return of value is risky, and may open the door to corruption and external scrutiny.”La Rose said that he talked to Blumer about the proposal and admitted that the proposal is risky, but said that was true of any change to the network. He said that EOS Nation’s team designed the system in a way to alleviate the risks:“Knowing there are inherent risks, we designed the system so it has a way to mitigate and lower the impact, as well as the overall likelihood of risks. [...] The system is built in a way that the long-term health and success of it is premised on that ratio of value created vs value extracted remaining positive — otherwise it shuts down, and does so automatically.”La Rose said that the EOS Nation’s team is committed to ensuring the WPS has clear and measurable returns of value for the EOS token holders. Because of this, the BP plans to deploy and perform an audit function for the system."

Currently the most notable example is the U.S., which recently announced an unlimited quantitative easing program and also reached an agreement for a $2 trillion stimulus package.The unlimited quantitative easing process will entail the Federal Reserve purchasing assets “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning” and after the announcement was made Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied almost 10% from $6,300 to $6,900.At the moment, Bitcoin has dropped to $6,630 and crypto markets have remained fairly stable throughout the day.Crypto market data.

In the last 3 days, silver has seen modest gains, surging from $12 to $14.5.Will QE save markets or irreparably damage the dollar?As the U.S. government sets out to spend billions of dollars this week, stock markets reacted positively and the S&P 500 rallied over 9% on March 24, the biggest daily surge since 2008. The Fed’s QE efforts may prop up stock prices for now but the long-term consequences will likely have a significant impact on the economy for years to come.While stock markets are currently reclaiming some of the ground lost during the past two weeks, the worst may be yet to come as the total impact of the Coronavirus and its effects on the population and on the economy are not yet visible.At the time of writing the number of newly confirmed cases is growing at an alarming rate.

Source: TradingViewInvestors watch safe-haven assets in a time of “unlimited” currencyTo the surprise of many investors, precious metals had been falling alongside global equity markets which on March 9 saw their worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. However, this isn’t entirely new for gold or silver.In 2008, safe-haven assets behaved similarly, dropping alongside stocks and rallying after the announcement of the Fed's quantitative easing program. For the time being, gold and silver seem to be back to providing security for traders and Bitcoin has been following the lead by holding its own in what could be its biggest test as a unique asset class so far.The Fed’s unprecedented new measures highlight one of the primary value propositions of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the issuance rate cannot be tampered with.What’s next for Bitcoin?As the current global financial meltdown has demonstrated, precious metals also have their weaknesses. On March 23, three of the world’s largest gold refineries announced that they would stop production for at least a week in order to comply with requests by local authorities. How this will weigh on price is yet to be determined.Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates on a decentralized system that ensures that no geo-specific event can alter its production. Unlike precious metals, Bitcoin’s system allows miners to leave and join the network without severely impacting the amount of Bitcoin mined.Over the past month the U.S. Dollar has also seen steady gains throughout the crisis due to the market participants quick exit from stocks and other risk-on assets. So far DXY has risen 6.35% in March but it has fallen by nearly 1% since the Fed’s announcement of unlimited QE.Coincidentally, Bitcoin is set to have its next halving event in April which will lower its issuance rate drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC every ten minutes. This means the supply will increase less than 2% per year, and will drop to less than 1% after 2024, a rate which is similar to the average rate of increase of the gold supply.As the Fed sets out to print an unlimited supply of dollars, Bitcoin is in a prime position to become the next ultimate store of value currency as its issuance rate remains relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming halving continues as programmed.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

For many decades, this usually meant either gold or gold mining company stocks, since they tended to have a negative correlation with the rest of the market.Over the last decade, many have been prophesying Bitcoin (BTC) as the “new gold”. During the recent crisis, however, investors have turned to the telecommunication stocks, with some Capital Hill investors ending up in hot water.Source: CryptoSlateThe motivation behind this convergence between traditional and crypto investors in the telecommunications sector seems obvious — the expectation that an increase in the remote workforce will create greater demand for these services.Need for privacyStatus (SNT), an Ethereum-based privacy messenger that is not included in CryptoSlate’s Communications sector, has gained 77% since the March 12 bloodbath.Source: Cointelegraph, CoinmarketcapJohnny Zerah, head of marketing at Status, shared with Cointelegraph that currently, the second most popular public channel on Status is dedicated to the coverage of Coronavirus around the world He noted that:“In these times, it’s important for people to have access to the information that doesn’t just come from the government sources”.This supports the thesis that the general public, and crypto community in particular, are growing weary of what they perceive as attempts by governments to increase surveillance under the guise of coronavirus protection.When it comes to Status messenger, investors may be betting on these fears.

Cho made hundreds of millions of won in cryptocurrency from the Nth Room Telegram chat rooms, which had a subscriber list of up to 260,000 people.More than 2.6 million people signed the petition demanding Cho be named and shamed on the presidential Blue House website. “Thank you for ending my unstoppable life as a devil,” he said on Wednesday outside Jongno Police Station in Seoul. “I apologise to those who were hurt because of me.”The National Policy Agency tracked down and arrested 124 people in total who were allegedly involved in the Telegram pornography ring.Crypto provided access to the Telegram porn ringAt least 74 victims are known to have been sexually exploited in the Nth Room, which was actually a series of at least 100 related chat rooms. Cho charged users between 200,000 and 1.5 million Korean won in cryptocurrency to access the rooms.The story was first made public in the Korean newspaper Hankyoreh last November. In early March Kookmin Ilbo reported further details of the horrific acts that outraged the nation.According to Kookmin Ilbo, one of the underage victims said she was extorted for over 40 sexual abuse videos while she was a middle school student in 2018.

The solution also reportedly allows for applications such as micropayments, voting, insurance contracts, and other uses that require low fees or instant transactions.According to a spokesperson of IOHK — the firm behind Cardano — Hydra is the result of a five-year European Union-funded collaborative research project, and could theoretically scale to a million transactions per second. Such a throughput is — according to him — in excess of the current generation of global payment systems.In Hydra, each user who connects to the network generates 10 heads, which are throughput lanes for data and transactions. Because of that, the system reportedly gets faster and decreases its latency as it scales.More scalable than VisaSimulations made by the University of Edinburgh show that each Hydra head can handle around 1,000 transactions per second, but according to the announcement, the process can be further optimized. The announcement reads:“With 1000 heads the network could theoretically scale to a million transactions per second - comfortably in excess of current global payment systems such as VISA.”Furthermore, according to the announcement, Hydra approaches the theoretical maximum amount of transactions possible within the limitations of network speed, geographical distance, and the number of participants. The paper reads:“Essentially, the bottleneck becomes the network connection between the participants, not the protocol.”The IOHK spokesperson did not answer Cointelegraph's inquiry by press time.Scalability is blockchain’s holy grailDirector of Edinburgh University’s Blockchain Laboratory, Aggelos Kiayias, commented on the development:“Solving the scalability question is the holy grail for the whole blockchain space. The time has come to apply a principled, evidence-based approach in designing and engineering blockchain scalability solutions and this research is a decisive step in this direction.”Recent evidence suggests that the Ethereum Foundation gave up on its second-layer solution, Plasma, without announcing it."

A total of 1,660,865 NEO worth approximately $11 million was released, with 27,800,303 NEO ($190 million) still remaining.According to its blog post, the Neo whitepaper allows the Foundation to sell its stake of NEO to “support Neo's technological development, ecosystem growth, community expansion.”The transaction ID published by the foundation reveals that the tokens were sent to an address that contains over 14.6 million NEO, worth $100 million. The announcement reads that the tokens were transferred from the “locked account to the current account,” which would imply that the foundation has an even deeper funding pool than the one contained in the first wallet.While the sparse transaction history seems to exclude the possibility that it is an exchange address, it could also be the exchange’s cold wallet. Neo Foundation representatives did not immediately answer Cointelegraph’s inquiries on the matter.The foundation also revealed that it completed the financial review for 2019, with an annual report to be “released soon” to the community.Background on NeoNeo, originally known as AntShares, is a blockchain platform based on BFT, a distributed Proof of Stake (dPoS) consensus algorithm.While it also supports tokens, the platform appears to be shifting its focus toward mainstream applications. This is also seen in its programming environment, which supports traditional languages such as C++ and JavaScript, as opposed to custom languages like Solidity.The project hasn’t often been in the spotlight recently, as it focuses on relaunching its blockchain for Neo 3.0. In early 2019, roadmap predictions placed its launch in Q2 2020.NEO co-founder, Da Hongfei, focused on the importance of blockchain at Blockshow Asia in improving the Internet’s data privacy, suggesting that this a potential development direction for Neo.In September, Neo joined Microsoft’s .NET Foundation as the first blockchain member."

Users can pay for the crypto asset via debit card or checking account.Furthermore, Tron users can also earn up to 5% cashback in MTL, Metal Pay’s proprietary tokens, on eligible transactions for sending and receiving United States dollars. The platform also allows its users to exchange TRX for over 20 other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).Metal Pay is a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp that also allows users to send money. It is designed to be usable by people who are completely unfamiliar with cryptocurrency.A Metal Pay spokesperson told Cointelegraph that signing up for the service requires identity verification since it involves creating a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured bank account. Accounts can purchase up to $3,000 per day, $12,000 per month or $40,000 per year.The last of many fiat on-ramp partnershipsPartnerships meant to provide direct fiat on-ramps to cryptocurrencies, tokens, and platforms are becoming increasingly frequent. As Cointelegraph reported in late February, United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency lending startup, Celsius Network, added in-app crypto purchases.During the same month, crypto exchange Binance also added 15 fiat currency options for purchasing cryptocurrencies on its trading platform."

Stepping up the game further in 2020, central banks across the globe sit in the spotlight as they consider central bank digital currencies (CBDC).“The term stablecoin is a broad term, which encompasses a variety of different types of assets, including assets that may be considered securities in certain jurisdictions,” the report explained, adding:“It has no legal or agreed definition itself. Stablecoins are marketed as having less price volatility than other crypto-assets and, it is argued, are more appropriate for certain use cases. Stablecoin initiatives often aim to create a store of value and means of exchange that is global, efficient and accessible.”The IOSCO board’s report detailed various stablecoin structures, the application of stablecoins to current IOSCO parameters, and the ways in which such assets might affect the governing bodies in charge of securities overwatch.The IOSCO will hash out current objectivesAs part of its Fintech Network, the IOSCO formed a Stablecoin Working Group for contemplating various stablecoin initiatives worldwide, in line with securities governing bodies, the report noted.“This report is IOSCO’s first published contribution to the ongoing public debate at international organisations and standard-setting bodies on global stablecoin proposals,” the document said, while also calling for comments and discussion on the whole stablecoin situation worldwide as it pertains to regulation.Amid economic instability surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. government has pursued several measures in an attempt to revive the markets, including its own stablecoin of sorts. Recent efforts included a digital U.S. dollar for sending funds to the unbanked population.Cointelegraph reached out to the IOSCO for additional details, but received no response as of press time.

Gox trustee to liquidate all crypto excluding BTC and BCHFunds will be allocated toward the rehabilitation proceedings first, with creditors receiving funds thereafter.Priority payments will be made to secure the interests of fiat currency claims, followed by small sum payments of up to approximately $1,800, and then prorated payments.The draft plan asserts that the trustee “may, with the permission of the court, sell all of part of the BTC/BCH constituting the debtor’s assets” to ensure that “a sufficient amount of cash” is secured.Claims requesting BTC or BCH may receive partial payout in cashThe trustee, attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, states that it has chosen “not to purchase additional BTC/BCH.”As such, it notes that “it is possible that there will be an insufficient amount of BTC/BCH as the source for distribution.” In such cases, claims requesting cryptocurrencies will receive a partial payment in fiat currency.It is estimated that 24,000 creditors have been impacted by the exchange’s 2011 hack and subsequent collapse in 2014. The exchange’s failure resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC.On March 24, the trustee launched an online portal through which creditors can view documents distributed during the creditors’ meeting — then estimated to be worth $460 million.The trustee has until March 31 to compile the final copy of its rehabilitation plan.Karpeles seeks dismissal of lawsuit alleging common fraudThe former CEO of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles, is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit against him alleging common fraud.In a filing submitted to the court on March 16, Karpeles took aim at the last remaining plaintiff in what was previously a class-action suit, Gregory Greene, for changing his claims against Karpeles midway through the case.Green has previously voluntarily dismissed two other claims made against the former CEO."

41919, Tone Vays Says Proposed Digital USD Is Nothing New ,2020-03-25t21:30:00+00:00,2114,86,"Markets trader and YouTuber, Tone Vays, says the United States’ digital dollar proposal is no different than the current system, except for its ties to the country’s federal reserve.“There is nothing technologically new here, whatsoever,” Vays said in a March 24 YouTube video, referencing the U.S. digital dollar proposal.“The only difference is that now, it’s like a pass-through from the Fed — as if the Fed needs more responsibility,” he added.Recent digital dollar draft from the governmentIn a recent attempt to help the sinking economy, a fresh stimulus draft surfaced on March 23, which, in part, proposed a digital U.S. dollar. The motion pushed for a digital dollar in tandem with a digital wallet, facilitating payments for folks deemed to have financial need.Composed of two parts, the stimulus saw drafts from Financial Services Committee Chairwoman, Maxine Waters, and Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, a Forbes contributor article detailed.No new tech advancements conveyedVays states the only difference from the current system is that citizens will receive money straight from the Federal Reserve, rather than private banks.“We already have a digital dollar,” Vays explained. “Ninety-nine percent of all dollars are digital,” he added, referencing the current economic system, which often does not deal in physical cash anymore.Vays also said the digital wallet is nothing new, pointing to mainstream options such as PayPal as a type of digital wallet. “When you see the term ‘a digital wallet’ — that does not have anything to do with Bitcoin or cryptography,” he said.Backing Vays’ point, neither draft mentions the word blockchain directly.The Fed’s involvement is newAlthough the stimulus did not mean new technology advancements, it did include additional involvement from the Federal Reserve. “Your money can be held at the Federal Reserve,” Vays said, as opposed to holding funds at banks such as Wells Fargo or Bank of America.“This is Congress’ attempt to nationalize the banking system,” Vays said, explaining that the concepts mentioned look like an attempt toward removing private banking.“This more reminds me of communist Russia, back when I grew up in communist Russia,” Vays noted, mentioning the Bank of Russia as the only banking option back then. “There was no private banking, right, there was just the Federal Reserve Bank of Russia,” he added. “That’s who held your money.”Vays posited this as a negative movement, although he did tally it as a long-term positive for Bitcoin as an asset uncontrolled by governments or borders."

During this event, the startup sells 25 virtual land parcels each week, for 10 weeks in a row, leading up to its Secondary Land Offering (SLO).Somnium will unveil the date for its SLO, expected in the latter half of 2020, after the Road to Secondary Land Offering ends on May 28.The VR outfit saw booming sales in OctoberSomnium sold 20% of its available land during its Initial Land Offering(ILO), in October 2019, receiving $200,000 total for the digital land, the statement revealed.As part of its 10-week event, Somnium offers 25 land parcels every Thursday in a Dutch-style auction – a type of bidding war that starts with high prices, lowering the offer until someone takes the bait and makes a purchase.Somnium puts the funds into developmentThe VR company puts a large portion of its raised funds back into the platform. “Somnium Space always uses the vast majority of community raised funds toward development and making our platform even better,” the Somnium rep said, adding:“We are rolling out new features weekly such as the release of our complementary 2D non-VR mode, live audio streaming and zones for Builder, Oculus Quest standalone app development and much more.”The representative also mentioned Somnium is currently “compatible with all PC VR headsets.”The rep also explained that only 5,000 Somnium land parcels exist. Somnium’s land naturally boasts resource scarcity, which prevents the platform from arbitrarily expanding its realm with new land creation.Blockchain-based virtual reality and its associated land sales seem to be an up and coming fad within the industry.

41917, Why Today’s 16% Fall in BTC Mining Difficulty May Cause the Price to Plunge ,2020-03-25t20:56:00+00:00,17623,165,"Bitcoin mining difficulty today dropped by 15.95 percent — the second largest decline in its history. The last time a downward adjustment took place, the Bitcoin price plummeted more than 50% percent.Bitcoin difficultyBitcoin’s difficulty is designed to adjust every 2016 blocks — or approximately every two weeks. This adjustment is based on changes in the network’s hashrate, and occurs regularly in an attempt to ensure that the network continues to solve new blocks at a rate of one every 10 minutes.If the hashrate during the past two weeks has gone up, the difficulty will go up as well, making mining more challenging. If the hashrate has dropped, the difficulty level will decrease, making blocks easier to solve. The latter event is somewhat uncommon, and is considered by some to be a historically ominous indicator for Bitcoin’s price. When the next adjustment takes place, mining difficulty is expected to ease by 13.67%.Recent historyThe last downward adjustment took place on February 25, 2020, when bitcoin price was $9,989.39. Three days later, it dropped to $8,785.52, and by March 14, had retreated to $4830.21. In a span of twenty days, bitcoin lost 52% percent of its value.Source: Cointelegraph, QuandleThe previous significant downward adjustment happened on November 7 2019. Bitcoin’s price on that date closed at $9,310.19. Some twenty days later, November 26, the price dropped to $6,907.4, surrendering 25.81% in total.Miners give upWhile this relationship could be a fluke, there is a rationale behind the trend. Downward difficulty adjustment completes the so-called “miners’ capitulation cycle.”In short, let’s say we are at a point where mining is highly profitable. This leads to more miners joining the network, increasing the hash rate. As a result, the difficulty adjusts upwards and the margins get a little thinner, but mining is still profitable, incentivizing more miners to join.This cycle continues until a relatively large proportion of miners cannot keep up anymore. Some are forced to liquidate an ever-increasing percentage of their newly mined Bitcoins, eventually depleting their treasuries. This causes an increased supply of bitcoins for sale on the market. At some point, they capitulate and stop mining. The hashrate decreases and, finally, the difficulty receives a downward reset.Philip Salter, head of operations at Genesis Mining, echoed this sentiment while speaking to Cointelegraph recently:“It’s no different from traditional markets, you have to sell everything to keep the operations going, to pay off your debts. As a miner you have bills to pay, you have to pay for electricity, for operations; and your expenses are in dollars, so as the price of bitcoin is dropping, it means you have to sell more of your inventory just to keep going.”Thanks to today’s massive decrease, this theory will soon be tested once more."
41914," Just Like Bitcoin Before It, Cardano Is Banned From Wikipedia ",2020-03-25t19:30:00+00:00,8598,227,"On March 24, Cardano (ADA) founder, Charles Hoskinson, streamed a YouTube video titled “On Wikipedia,” in which he berated Wikipedia for applying arbitrary commercial censorship against Cardano.Wikipedia’s censorship of Bitcoin may have led to Satoshi’s disappearanceCensorship of cryptocurrency projects is as old as the industry itself. Back in 2010, even Satoshi Nakamoto was frustrated with Wikipedia’s editors for removing Bitcoin’s wiki entry several times.After PayPal severed ties with WikiLeaks, one of Bitcoin’s supporters suggested that becoming the site's new source of donations would generate enough publicity to gain entry into Wikipedia. Satoshi strongly opposed WikiLeak’s adoption of the cryptocurrency, but it was too late:“No, don't ""bring it on"". The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.”Cardano & SpankChainHoskinson states that he does not know the rationale behind Wikipedia’s hostility towards his project, despite it being “the most cited of all of the peer reviewed coins”:“We don't know why there's hostility where coins like SpankChain can have an article on Wikipedia. A lot of other cryptocurrencies and top 15, top 20 apparently have articles and that's perfectly fine. But then we're not allowed to have an article for some reason, even though we've been mentioned by the U.S. Congress.”Cointelegraph could not find a Wikipedia article for SpankChain (SPANK). Other projects like Dogecoin (DOGE), GridCoin (GRC), and PotCoin (POT) do have one, however. Most of the top ten projects, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), have one too.Source: CointelegraphHoskinson confirmed to Cointelegraph that the censorship comes exclusively from Wikipedia’s English language editors, noting that there are Cardano wiki entries in German, Estonian, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian.Crypto censorship has recently been on the rise. In Wikipedia’s case, it is an especially surprising move, considering that the site accepts Bitcoin to help fund its mission of providing “a free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world”"

The company was also forced to withdraw its full-year 2020 guidance, and “expects to provide a further update on its first-quarter 2020 earnings call in May.”Bitcoin growthSquare’s CashApp supports Bitcoin transactions and generates significant revenue for the company. In the fourth quarter of 2019 alone, the service generated $178 million.Despite the company’s struggles and the latest economic downturn, CashApp has seen increased adoption and investments in Bitcoin, according to the company’s spokesperson. Meanwhile, Square’s stock was up 15.75% on the day.The company’s updated revenue outlook seems to support the idea that as the global economic panic deepens, more investors may seek shelter in Bitcoin."

As the value of the cryptocurrency changes, so too does the artwork, explained Kane:""Each day, a new look for the Master is generated using a data feed of Bitcoin's last 24 hours of price action.

Some Layers can change outfits, others can substitute faces, and still others can change size or orientation. async.art notes that this enables over 54 billion distinct state changes in the piece.The individual Layers were sold for a total of 263 ETH, suggesting that collectors value the opportunity to have direct input into the appearance of the Master artwork.In the case of Right Place & Right Time, the artist retains control of the Layers, which are controlled by API calls.Kane explained that ""I want to keep the artwork fresh and surprising for both collector and viewers as price volatility is visualized –and maintain this as a living work-in-progress. Additionally, when Bitcoin's price reaches key levels, that achievement is recorded as part of the artwork that day.""async.art founder CEO Conlan Rios said that “We are now truly on track to impact the art world… it reinforces the fact that the entire NFT community believes in this movement.”The new piece will be unveiled at a virtual gallery showcase event, Citadel 6.15, hosted by crypto artist Coldie and opening on March 27th in the Cryptovoxels world.Cointelegraph Magazine has been focusing on the crypto art movement this week, in a series of features exploring ephemerality, art communities and collaboratives, and censorship.Original artworks by Cointelegraph artists will be on display at the exhibition, alongside works from noted crypto artists including Coldie, Hackatao, AlottaMoney, XCOPY, Josie Bellini, Shortcut, BlackBoxDotArt, MLIBTY, TwistedVacancy, Matt Kane, Rutger van der Tas, Vans Design, and Connie Digital.More information on Cointelegraph Magazine Art Week and the Citadel 6.15 Virtual Art Show can be found here.(Artworks courtesy async.art)"

41908, The Role of Cryptocurrencies in the Rise of Ransomware ,2020-03-25t18:35:00+00:00,2227,116,"Cryptocurrency and ransomware have had a long history together. They are so closely intertwined, in fact, that many have blamed the rise of cryptocurrency for a parallel rise in ransomware attacks.Ransomware attacks are certainly increasing — they rose by 118% in 2018 — but it’s not clear that this is due to cryptocurrency. While the vast majority of ransoms are paid in crypto, the transparent nature of these currencies actually means that they are a pretty bad place to hide stolen funds.In this article, we’ll take a look at the relationship between cryptocurrency and ransomware, as well as what the future holds.The ransomware crypto economyThere are at least two ways in which cryptocurrency is important for ransomware attacks. The first one is the most obvious — the majority of the ransoms paid during these kinds of attacks are generally in cryptocurrency. This was the case, for instance, in the WannaCry ransomware attacks, still the largest attack of its kind in history. Victims of the attack were instructed to send roughly $300 of Bitcoin (BTC) to their attackers.There is another way in which crypto and ransomware are intertwined, though. Today, plenty of hackers are offering “ransomware as a service,” essentially letting anyone hire a hacker from online marketplaces. If you are so inclined, you can even buy ransomware off-the-shelf from these marketplaces. Both of these “services” can be paid for in — you’ve guessed it — cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency is also implicated in many other forms of cyberattack. Cryptojacking — a form of attack that uses victim’s computers to mine cryptocurrencies — is also on the rise, and new forms of malware such as Adylkuzz can be used by almost anyone with even a slight level of technical knowledge. Though these forms of attack are not technically ransomware, they further suggest the deep relationship between cryptocurrency and cybercrime.Following the moneyAt first glance, it seems obvious that ransomware hackers would demand payment in cryptocurrency. Surely these currencies, based on anonymity and encryption, offer the best place to store stolen funds?Well, not really. There is actually a different reason why ransomware attacks make use of cryptocurrencies. As Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote in 2017, it is the efficiency of cryptocurrency networks, rather than their secrecy, that attracts hackers. As he later put it:“It’s electronic cash, so it’s easy to write software that can automatically demand payment and automatically demand that payment has been made.”The value of cryptocurrency during a ransomware attack is actually the transparency of cryptocurrency exchanges. A hacker can simply watch the public blockchain to see if victims have paid up, and can automate the process of giving a victim their files back once this payment has been received.This point also suggests a slightly curious aspect of the role of crypto in ransomware attacks: Cryptocurrency is, perhaps, the worst place to store ransom money. The open, transparent, nature of Bitcoin blockchain transactions means that the global community is closely watching the ransom money. That makes it extremely difficult to convert these funds into another currency, and means that they can be tracked by law enforcement.As the director of research at Coin Center, Peter Van Valkenburgh, stated:“In the U.S., every major bitcoin exchange is regulated by FINCEN. Right now the $50,000 extorted from victims is just sitting on the bitcoin network. ... That [exchange into local currency] is where you’re vulnerable to being identified.”Regulation and enforcementThe fact that stolen funds can be tracked in this way doesn’t necessarily mean that the hackers who stole them can be brought to justice, of course. The anonymity of cryptocurrency means that it is often impossible for law enforcement agencies to uncover the true identity of ransomware hackers, though of course there are exceptions.Chief among these, according to Coin Center, is that the “blockchain allows one to trace all transactions involving a given bitcoin address, all the way back to the first transaction. That gives law enforcement the records it needs to ‘follow the money’ in a way that would never be possible with cash.”Because of that, and also in response to a number of recent high-profile ransomware attacks, some have called for cryptocurrency to be regulated more closely. Regulation will need to be implemented carefully, however, because one of the major attractions of cryptocurrency — for ordinary citizens and hackers alike — is the fact that it is anonymous.This means that attempts to regulate the space may make catching criminals even more difficult. As pointed out by Will Ellis, head of research at community advocacy group Privacy Australia, cryptocurrency bans led to a rise in VPN use, as investors seek to circumvent Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements in their home countries.In addition, most governments simply don’t have the understanding or the resources to regulate the crypto space effectively. Some are so far behind that they aren’t even certain how to define what cryptocurrencies are. In this context, it is difficult to see how the close link between ransomware and cryptocurrency can ever be broken.Related: From the UK to Malaysia: How Countries Have Been Classifying Crypto Across the WorldThe bottom lineThe lack of governmental oversight of cryptocurrency, combined with the rapid rise in ransomware attacks, means that individuals need to protect themselves.Some companies and individuals have taken unusual approaches. Companies have stockpiled Bitcoin not as an investment, but rather in case they need to pay a ransom as part of a future attack. Some enterprising individuals have even taken matters into their own hands, such as the German programmer who “hacked back” following a cyberattack using his own systems.For most of us, though, protecting against ransomware attacks means doing the basics correctly. You should ensure that all of your systems are up to date, subscribe to a secure cloud storage provider and backup frequently. Companies of all sizes should partner with a managed security services provider to monitor enterprise networks, perform risk assessments and make recommendations specific to their data environment.Ultimately, the relationship between cryptocurrency and ransomware is unlikely to be broken anytime soon. And while cryptocurrencies are certainly involved in the majority of ransomware attacks, we should not make the mistake of blaming crime on the currency it is conducted in.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Sam Bocetta is a freelance journalist specializing in U.S. diplomacy and national security, with an emphasis on technology trends in cyber warfare, cyber defense and cryptography.

41905, Kleiman Estate Seeks Two-Week Extension Amid COVID-19 Lockdown ,2020-03-25t18:30:00+00:00,1085,75,"In the latest disruption to the case between the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright, and the estate of the late Dave Kleiman, the plaintiffs are seeking a two-week extension to discovery amid the coronavirus pandemic.In a motion filed on March 24, Dave Kleiman’s estate asserts that the COVID-19 lockdown has presented “numerous complications associated with meeting deadlines set prior to the onset of the global pandemic.”The COVID-19 pandemic makes depositions improbableWith the plaintiffs’ representation currently working from home due to the law firms temporarily closing their offices, the Kleiman estate is requesting a two-week extension to complete three fact witness depositions. They stated:“Offices are closed, support staff are not onsite, experts and lawyers are unable to travel, in-person meetings are not possible, and the ability to review documents in a collaborative manner has been trying, to say the least.”In light of the disruptions, the plaintiffs request that the hearing date for the parties to disclose expert witness summaries be postponed from March 27 until April 10, and that the deadline for fact discovery be pushed forward from April 17 to May 1.Plaintiffs accuse Jimmy Nguyen of evading subpoenaThe estate also notes that they have been trying to serve a deposition subpoena to nChain chief executive, Jimmy Nguyen, since Feb. 14, including five attempts at his home during February alone.The motion, which accuses Nguyen of either intentionally evading service, traveling outside of the country, or both, says that:“Mr. Nguyen’s Twitter feed indicates that, over the past few months, he has spent a significant amount of time traveling outside of the country with Dr. Wright. He would therefore be aware of the discovery cutoff, and know that Plaintiffs are running out of time to serve him.”Judge slams Wright for forged documentsThe case between Wright and Kleiman’s estate has been anything but smooth, with Wright coming under fire on multiple occasions for producing forged documents and giving perjured testimony throughout the case.Last week, U.S. Magistrate, Judge Reinhart, ruled that Wright must pay almost $166,000 in attorney and expense fees to the Kleiman estate."

Looking at performance relative to its peers, Ether (ETH) and XRP both underperformed versus Bitcoin last week against the U.S. dollar and have continued to do so.As a result, Bitcoin dominance is up 1.5% and pushing to reclaim 68% as there has been a general flight to safety in Bitcoin, although dominance is still down some 4% for the highs of the year at around 70%.Cryptocurrency market 7-day view. Source:Coin3603-day Bitcoin chartBTCUSD 3 Day chart. Source: TradingviewBitcoin is trading up against what is a fundamental decision point at $6.8K. This is previous support now acting as resistance and the top of a high volume node which is dissected by a diagonal resistance trend line, which dates back to mid-2019.Reclaiming $6.5K has been a sign of strength by the bulls who catapulted Bitcoin higher off the 200-week moving average in the mid $5Ks. Looking at the big picture, a meaningful break out of the $6.8K resistance would see Bitcoin first attack $7,200 — the 50% retracement of the 2020 lows to highs — but above that stands formidable resistance.“Death cross” loomsThere is a so-called “death cross” taking place today overhead at $8300 where the 50-day moving average is crossing below the 200-day moving average, which is a crowded cluster of other former support levels, namely the 100-day and the 20-week moving averages. Alongside this is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $8K and yearly pivot at $8,100 and a high volume node, implying that it will be a real challenge for the bulls to break beyond this point.BTCUSD 3 Day chart. Source: TradingviewThe 3-day Bitcoin chart helps illustrate the persistently high volume being transacted by the bulls, albeit declining in its momentum, the volume at the 200-week moving average has resulted in the OBV printing the biggest surge to the upside in recent times and is indicative of real support around the mid $5Ks.4-hour Bitcoin ChartBTCUSD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong trend pressing Bitcoin up against the $6.8K resistance level with the structure arguably being in a rising wedge pattern, which is typically bearish when accompanied by decreasing volume as is apparent here. The RSI is also showing bearish divergence which adds to the bearish case.If the bulls are unable to regain the $6,800 level, the 200-week moving average is lying below at around $5,500 on a high volume node, which was previously front run in the last attempt to break $6,800. Should the bulls find their feet again, diagonal support will be found at $6,250.Typically in Bitcoin’s history, we have seen a rally into the death crosses and depreciation into a golden cross. If the bulls can break the $6,800 level, there is a high probability of selling pressure around $8K due to the confluence of previously lost support now likely to act as resistance.Bitcoin market sentimentThe Crypto fear and Greed index, which is a metric deriving the sentiment in the market from various inputs, shows unsurprisingly that the market remains in extreme fear meaning that there is likely to be more market volatility on the way.The last time that fear was at these lows for any amount of time was in December 2018 at the lows of the 2018 bear market and interestingly also at the 200-week moving average. The 200-week moving average was ultimately a magnet for a retest although price never quite made it and was front ran, which was a good indicator the bottom was in. It is possible we are setting up for the same scenario again here.Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Source:Fear and Greed IndexThe futures market also gives an insight into what the expectation is for the price of Bitcoin with contracts ending in June currently trading in backwardation with a discount from spot prices of around 1%. However, there is an expectation of some recovery and higher valuation for the September contract close.Bitcoin Futures Prices Source:SkewPerpetual swap funding also remains negative in the market, meaning that in order to achieve a synthetic cash position on a perpetual swap exchange, market participants are effectively paying an interest rate.Historically, there has been an inverse relationship between negative funding and propensity for the market to turn bullish so this may indicate that eventually those paying to be in a short position for longer periods while price remains flat above the 200 WMA will naturally be squeezed out.BTCUSD 15 Minute BItmex Funding chart. Source: TradingviewLooking forwardWith global uncertainty reaching all-time highs at present and with the commitment from central banks to provide “unlimited” liquidity in the form of debt, Bitcoin finds itself at ground zero in terms of its purpose for its creation.While global assets are depreciating in real terms, Bitcoin’s inflationary supply is due to be cut in half in May and once the dust settles on the global markets, it may be that there is a flow of idle dollars into the Bitcoin market.This macroeconomic backdrop could prove to be very beneficial to the price of Bitcoin. The key challenge is to maintain the 200-week moving average and miner’s revenue above production cost, which is presently the case.Assuming the 200-week moving average will be retained and $8K will be the resistance expected, Bitcoin may find itself trading sideways between the $6K and $8K for some time before a decisive move. The backdrop couldn’t be a better time to talk about the halving and in a few weeks that will present itself as being an imminent event that could be the catalyst to take Bitcoin back above resistance; time will tell with 49 days remaining until Bitcoin reward halving."
41902, Hive Continues Independence Push as Steem Stakeholders Migrate to New Chain ,2020-03-25t16:02:00+00:00,2643,168,"Over the past few days, the ex-Steem blockchain community has gained an upper hand over Justin Sun and his recently acquired Steemit startup. After blaming Sun for attempting to centralize their network, a substantial part of the original Steem community successfully launched a hard fork called Hive.Steem stakeholders are now actively migrating to the new chain. Its in-house token HIVE, which has been distributed among STEEM holders via an airdrop, is trading for a 20% premium over STEEM on some exchanges. Nonetheless, the network split hasn’t been without incident, as some complaints regarding the airdrop distribution were reported.What is the conflict all about?The dispute can be traced back to February 2020. At the time, Justin Sun, an eminent Chinese tech entrepreneur with an estimated net worth of $200 million, purchased Steemit, Inc. — a startup founded by Ned Scott and Dan Larimer, the same people who launched the Steem blockchain. The company is known primarily for releasing Steem-based alternatives for key social media outlets like Reddit, YouTube and Instagram.It is still not clear whether Sun purchased all shares of Steemit, since Scott’s original tweet announcing that he had sold Steemit to Sun has been deleted. Official press kits refer to the merger as a “strategic partnership” between Steemit and Tron, a major cryptocurrency firm launched by the Chinese entrepreneur.As Steemit managing director Elizabeth Powell told Cointelegraph soon after the acquisition, the Tron partnership was vital for her company’s financial health. According to reports from November 2018, Steemit had to lay off more than 70% of its staff due to market conditions.The community appeared less optimistic about the merger. On Feb. 24, a group of Steem stakeholders performed a soft fork and deactivated the so-called “ninja-mined stake,” a stash of approximately 74 million STEEM tokens historically owned by Steemit. As a Steem Witness previously explained to Cointelegraph, the stake has been a long-standing concern for the Steem community, and stakeholders became even more worried about its future once Justin Sun became Steemit’s CEO.In response, Tron arranged what has since been described as a “hostile takeover.” On March 2, three major cryptocurrency exchanges that have STEEM tokens listed on their platforms, namely Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, unwittingly used customer deposits to stake large amounts of STEEM tokens to vote in support of removing the original witnesses.As a result, all of the top-20 witnesses were eventually replaced with accounts powered by Steemit, Binance, Huobi and Poloniex. Sun then described the takeover as a successful attempt at defeating the “hackers” who froze assets legally owned by Steemit.Soon after Sun’s announcement, both Binance and Huobi declared that they were removing their votes in order to undo the takeover, as they were initially not fully aware of the situation to which they contributed. Additionally, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao appeared to distance himself from Sun in an interview with Cointelegraph.Meanwhile, the Steem community was actively trying to reclaim its space back by mobilizing tokens. As of March 6, 10 out of 20 top witnesses were “approved,” while the remaining 10 witnesses appeared to be Steemit-affiliated players. A discussion between a group of Steem community members and Justin Sun was also held around the same time. According to a recording of the conversation, Sun mentioned that they wanted to “withdraw our votes also ASAP to give rights back to the community.”Some investors claim to be mistakenly excluded from the airdropDespite the ostensible promises to “give rights back to the community,” the Tron Foundation CEO reportedly continued to use “sock-puppet witnesses” to consolidate power on the Steem blockchain, as previously told to Cointelegraph by a number of ex-Steem stakeholders. In light of this, the stakeholders decided to proceed with a hard fork called Hive, initially an exact code fork of the Steem blockchain that has been altered based on community feedback.The hard fork successfully took place on March 20 at around 9:30 a.m. UTC. The network split was accompanied by a 1:1 airdrop, which notably blacklisted the purported owners of Steemit’s “ninja-mined” stake, currently worth around $9.25 million, and the alleged “Tron puppets” who proxied their vote to Steemit-affiliated witnesses during the infamous takeover.Not all Steem stakeholders are happy with the exclusion algorithm, as some have allegedly been left out. Scott Cunningham, one of the STEEM holders, told Cointelegraph that he “and a few others” were mistakenly added to the banlist via an algorithm meant to pick up on specific behavior:“The main behaviour was whether or not you voted for TRON witnesses which I did not. I proxied my vote to the creator of 3Speak @TheyCallMeDan who was actively supporting and helping the original Steem witnesses that now make up Hive.”Cunningham then contacted the Hive team, which reportedly delegated him with his original power. Additionally, they promised him that over the next week, they “will fix the mistakes made by the algorithmic airdrop blacklist.” Cunningham went on to add that although he does not entirely agree with the way the algorithm works, he still believes that Hive will prove to be a more decentralized platform than Steem:“I think it’s fair to withhold Steemit’s airdrop to prevent them from having the ninja-mined stake, but I don’t think it’s fair to penalize people based on their voting. It’s not fully decentralized if you're penalized for the way you vote even if you vote for centralization or naively. That being said, I still understand the precautions they have taken and given there are no other ways implemented to penalize people, I think their network will prove to be a much more decentralized one.”Dan Notestein, the CEO and founder of BlockTrades, a top-three Hive validator who has been working on the hard fork, confirmed to Cointelegraph the airdrop exclusion list is based on one principle: “The Hive community would not airdrop on Steemians that actively supported the centralization of the blockchain by Justin Sun by voting for the sockpuppet witnesses run by Justin Sun.”The list was created by running a script that analyzed the blockchain data for witness voting, Notestein added, elaborating on how the mechanism was designed: “To avoid as many false positives as possible, we required at least votes for two sockpuppets, and we also excluded accounts of a small size, as they were considered more likely to be users that might not be aware of what they were doing by voting for the sockpuppet witnesses.”Notestein also admitted that the Hive team was “extremely rushed” and is aware that there might be errors in the script, which is why it plans to reevaluate the distribution scheme in the near future:“We decided that we would have stake-based votes after the Hive chain was launched to determine if some accounts were unreasonably excluded from the airdrop of Hive tokens. Such accounts will receive an airdrop in the next planned hardfork. I know of at least one actual coding mistake in the initial script that I believe will probably result in some accounts receiving tokens in the second airdrop.”Hive has more post-hard fork plansIn its post-fork announcement, Hive reported that an unspecified number of exchanges are working to list HIVE tokens, in addition to six trading platforms who are still working on distributing airdropped assets.Since then, Binance has announced that it completed the distribution of HIVE tokens to STEEM holders. In addition, the exchange clarified that to get listed on the platform, HIVE “will go through the same strict listing review process as Binance does for any other coin/token.” A representative for the exchange told Cointelegraph:“Binance won’t be taking a position on the dispute itself, but we’ll continue to keep tabs on the situation and keep users informed of any changes that might affect them,” a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph.Meanwhile, Steem stakeholders seem to be actively migrating to the Hive network. For instance, PeakD — the Hive-based version of Steempeaked and the second-largest front-end interface on the Steem platform — has already been launched. Additionally, long-time Steem witnesses are reorganizing their operation in favor of Hive by disabling their accounts on the former chain.“I don’t plan to post more content on Steem,” Luke Stokes, one of original Steem Witnesses, told Cointelegraph, noting that he might update his content there to point to PeakD instead. He also stressed that many Witnesses have kept their nodes running but are purposely not signing blocks, which is why the participation level sometimes drops below 100%.“There is a general consensus among the former top Steem block producers and DApps to move to Hive,” Notestein argued in a conversation with Cointelegraph:“Many have already shutdown their nodes on Steem, and I expect most if not all to shut them down soon, as they find time to do so. [...] For myself, I’ve stopped interacting on Steem and only interact on Hive now, and this includes disabling my Steem witness node.”Additionally, the post-fork statement mentioned that Hive.blog wallets will be launched soon, directing people to consider using the PeakD.com wallet in the meantime. Hive team also mentioned that there will be a second hard fork in the near future to upgrade the blockchain and bring additional functionality online, although little detail is available in that regard.Hive falloutThe hard fork has not gone unnoticed by third-party actors: Canada-based mining firm Hive Blockchain recently announced a cease and desist request to the Hive community. The firm argues that the new use of the term “Hive” is “intentionally or otherwise, confusing with the Company’s brand”, citing “multiple shareholder inquiries understandably confused by this Blockchain’s announcement.”David Jefferys, an ex-director of business development at Steemit who has been involved with the Hive hard fork, previously told Cointelegraph that Hive “isn’t even a company or official organization yet,” since apparently “there’s been no time” to deal with the registration process. According to Jefferys, currently Hive is “a pure, community-driven, truly decentralized social blockchain project.” As for the most recent developments, he said:“Steem and Hive may turn into revieraliers born of the same blood which will be a fun movie for the crypto industry to watch play out and will likely lift both chains higher together”.Meanwhile, the market has been reacting positively to the new network, since HIVE has even been traded for a 20–40% premium over STEEM on select platforms. For instance, on Bittrex, HIVE is currently trading for $0.26, while STEEM is being sold for just around $0.17 there. However, the premium does not seem to extend to other platforms — another exchange which has both assets listed, the South Korea-based Probit, trades HIVE and STEEM for $0.23 and $0.17 respectively.Cointelegraph has reached out to Steemit and Tron Foundation for a comment and will update this story if more details surface."

Philip Moustakis, attorney at Seward & Kissel LLP and former SEC counsel, told Cointelegraph that Telegram’s legal team will have their work cut out for them before the court of appeals:“The standard of review on appeal is abuse of discretion — it’s a high bar — meaning Telegram will have to show the district court made some clear mistake of fact or an error of law.”Telegram’s distribution of GRAMs has been on hold since the SEC’s emergency action in October, in which the regulator deemed the $1.7 billion initial coin offering to be an unregistered and therefore illegal securities offering.Cointelegraph reached out to Telegram’s legal team but had received no response as of press time.

The exchange has also pledged to match up to an additional $1 million in public donations.Binance Charity to publish all transactions made with donated fundsThe funds will be spent primarily on medical equipment and supplies that will be distributed throughout Italy, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Iran, Turkey, the United States, and the United Kingdom.Binance Charity asserts that all transactions made with the donated funds will be published publicly to ensure full transparency.Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, stated:“The crypto community is a growing force and we have an opportunity to strengthen this through philanthropy. We encourage the community to take part in this initiative as we unite against COVID-19, and together, we'll drive impact.”Binance donates $1.4 million in medical supplies in ChinaBinance Charity’s global campaign to combat the coronavirus follows similar efforts that have been successful within mainland China.During January, Binance committed to purchasing $1.4 million in medical supplies through its “Binance for Wuhan” project.As of March 20, the initiative had purchased 366,000 pairs of gloves, 56,800 masks, 9 sterilizers, 5,280 bottles of hand sanitizers, 20,000 testing kits, 7,850 protective suits, 20,000 pairs of goggles, 388 oxygen concentrators, 1000 germicidal lamps, and roughly five tons of disinfectant.The supplies have been distributed to more than 300 hospitals and medical teams including Hubei, Sichuan, Guangxi, Shanghai, and other Chinese provinces at the epicenter of the pandemic.The most important element of human life is to show compassion and help others as we can, without the limitation or restriction of borders,"" stated Binance Charity's head, Helen Hai.""Blockchain technology enables this in greater capacities than ever before and Binance Charity wishes to bring this to the masses,"" she added."
41893, Mt. Gox Casts a Dark Shadow of Crypto’s Collapse — A Long Fight for Justice ,2020-03-25t13:33:00+00:00,3203,69,"Mt. Gox’s creditors met today to discuss a draft rehabilitation plan as part of a compensation process that seems to go on and on. This news comes at a unique time: amid a pandemic and with the world on the brink of economic crisis. It calls to mind again the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange that once accounted for 70% of the world’s Bitcoin (BTC) trading, a signal moment in crypto history.In anxious times like these, people are inevitably asking: Can a failure of this scale happen again? Earlier this week, the crypto hedge fund Adaptive Capital announced that it would cease operations after suffering heavy losses during the March 13 crypto market meltdown. Other disruptions are expected as entire national economies shut down to fight the coronavirus.A never-ending process?Meanwhile, the claims and lawsuits against Mt. Gox continue.Mark Karpelès, the exchange’s former CEO, remains embroiled in an active lawsuit with investor Gregory Greene, as Cointelegraph reported on March 17. Coinlab, a former business partner, has a $16 billion (1.7 trillion Japanese yen) bankruptcy claim against Mt. Gox, up from the $75 million claim originally filed.The former exchange’s 24,000 creditors, meanwhile, are still waiting for a rehabilitation fund overseen by trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi to be distributed, and even though a draft plan has been approved, it is yet to be filed to the court, and even then, it may take more time for creditors to get their assets back in the form of crypto or fiat.Elsewhere, Fortress Investment Group raised its offer to purchase claims from Mt. Gox creditors. As of February, they are offering $1,300 per Bitcoin lost, up from $755 in December 2019.It seems like a mess, and it’s easy to forget that Mt. Gox was once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, handling more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. When it filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, it announced that 850,000 Bitcoins were missing, presumably stolen. A little over 200,000 Bitcoins were eventually recovered, and that’s basically what the parties are now fighting over.Litigation persistsIs it surprising that lawsuits continue? The amount of Bitcoin stolen was worth around $473 million at the time, but those that were recovered would be worth $1.7 billion today. “I’m not surprised some people are suing,” said Johnny Lee, Grant Thornton LLP’s national practice leader for forensic technology services.One also sees more tort claims directed at crypto generally, Lee added. “It’s just the beginning of that trend.” Exchanges and other custodians are increasingly going to pay the price for failing to exert sufficient fiduciary duty. Pascal Gauthier, the CEO of Ledger, told Cointelegraph:“Cryptocurrencies are a complex digital asset, and the sheer loss of that much money is something we’ve never seen before in the industry, so I’m not particularly surprised this case is still being litigated.”Moreover, the security technology used by Mt. Gox didn’t leave a particularly clear audit trail, which probably drew the legal process out further. When could Mt. Gox’s creditors eventually see some money? It may take a while still. In an interview with Cointelegraph last year, Karpelès outlined his belief that Coinlab is interested in prolonging the case in hopes of reaching a higher settlement.“Painful lesson”""It was a pivotal moment in Bitcoin history,” wrote Ian DeMartino in a chapter of The Bitcoin Handbook titled “Mt. Gox: Bitcoin’s Defining Moment?” He continued: “Arguably, it was the most important event so far, negative or positive, for the still-young currency.”The world now has more than 200 exchanges — not just one — on which to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While that offers some comfort in terms of diversification, a number of these are still offshore enterprises operating without the benefit of regulation or transparency. Kim Nilsson, the chief engineer of WizSec who led an investigation into Mt. Gox’s “missing” Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph:“Isn’t this the main painful lesson from Mt. Gox — that something that looks like the most authoritative and legitimate business of its kind could be a complete disaster on the inside and you might not have any idea until it was too late?”Could history repeat itself, then? Markus Veith, a partner in the audit practice at Grant Thornton LLP and the leader of the professional services firm’s digital-assets practice, told Cointelegraph: “Mt. Gox was hacked mostly in hot wallets. Today, 95% of our clients’ Bitcoins are in cold storage.” Some clients have gone so far as to put their private keys on flash drives that are stored in former military bunkers. These stored private keys should, at the very least, be impervious to hackers — i.e., people sitting at computers — and many other malefactors.The Mt. Gox hacks and the others that followed gave rise to a whole new awareness and new specialties, like crypto custodians — Fidelity Digital Assets, for example — added Veith. Many of today’s crypto exchanges also carry insurance against theft. Nilsson added:“My gut feeling is that, on average, exchanges are probably more secure today, as some exchanges have taken things like audits and provable holdings to heart and have simply had much more time to build a proper business, but the general quandary of limited insight remains, with most exchanges running fairly opaque operations. A lot of people tend not to worry about the security or reliability of their chosen exchange until it's too late, the same as before.”A new leadership?One sometimes forgets that the crypto world has existed for only 12 years. The early exchanges were created and run by programmers and other technical specialists, noted Lee. For instance, Karpelès, who acquired the Mt. Gox Bitcoin-exchange site from programmer Jed McCaleb in 2011, was a PHP developer.“The later ventures had more traditional financial services leadership and they often pro-actively sought regulation,” Lee told Cointelegraph. Instead of domiciling offshore in an effort to avoid regulation, “they assumed they would eventually be beholden to U.S. securities law and they sought to comply.”“The first wave of entrepreneurs were evangelists for the technology, but low on quality,” Nick Shalek, a general partner at Ribbit Capital, told Reuters at the time of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy filing. With time, a more financially focused group of entrepreneurs emerged, intent on building more serious infrastructure around Bitcoin.Reported volume is fakeThat doesn’t mean today’s exchanges are model enterprises. “We're still seeing news of exchanges or other businesses folding under pretty eye-catching circumstances — QuadrigaCX springs to mind,” said Nilsson, referring to the Canadian crypto exchange, whose founder reportedly died in late 2018 and which still owes around $145 million to its 115,000 creditors.In a May 2019 report, Bitwise Asset Management noted that Bitcoin trading volume adds to roughly $6 billion per day, “but under the hood the exchanges that report the highest volumes are unrecognizable. The vast majority [95%] of this reported volume is fake and/or non-economic wash trading.” Still, that same Bitwise research suggested that the Bitcoin market has significantly matured in recent years. Nilsson commented on the matter:“These days there obviously exists a much larger number of crypto exchanges than back in the age of Mt. Gox, so there's probably a wide spectrum with many superior businesses but probably also many worse than Mt. Gox, where the saving grace is just that all the eggs are no longer in one basket, so to speak.”Systemic risk?Others note that while blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized, the crypto exchanges upon which they trade remain largely centralized with private owners. “To fix this, decentralized exchanges have been built,” wrote DeMartino. “They aren't popular at this time because they tend to be slow, but they do work.""""Most cryptocurrency owners today do not truly own cryptocurrencies,"" observed Quinn DuPont in his book Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains. They instead trade them on privately owned exchanges. The wealth that has been stored on these “centralized services” presents a systemic market risk, he argues, ""not unlike the 'too big to fail' banks of the 2008 global economic crisis."" It’s not as bad as when Mt. Gox was so dominant, but the risk remains.Could something as spectacular as the Mt. Gox collapse take place again? “On the technical front, absolutely,” answered Nilsson. “But there's no longer one dominant exchange handling the bulk of all trading, so we'll hopefully never see something with as large a potential impact as Mt. Gox did.”“Good governance, a clear audit trail, and account segregation — these are the essentials to avoid a Mt. Gox 2 scenario,” said Gauthier. DeMartino wrote on the matter, ""The most positive thing that can be said about the Mt. Gox fiasco [...] is that it did not kill Bitcoin.” Thus, people continued to invest their money in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in ever larger amounts.Still, that was then, and this is now. Surviving a single bankruptcy in a period of economic expansion — even a loss as critical as the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014 — is a different sort of industry challenge than outlasting a Great Depression.The good news is that with more than 200 exchanges spread around the world — many of them covered by insurance and many professionally managed — the risk of a total crypto calamity is significantly diminished when compared to six years ago."
41892, Bitcoin for Business: The Tax Guide ,2020-03-25t13:19:00+00:00,2152,122,"During 2019 alone, thousands of merchants worldwide were accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment method. Despite this, a lot of current and would-be merchants are confused about how to pay taxes on their cryptocurrency sales.This guide was created by a United States business owner that advocates for cryptocurrency and a crypto tax expert to cover both practical aspects and tax tips for businesses that wish to accept cryptocurrencies. So whether your clients are asking or you desire to support the growth of the crypto ecosystem, here is the right way to do it.Cryptocurrency tax law varies by countryEach country has its own tax rules. Some, such as Portugal and France, look favorably on cryptocurrencies, while others like the U.S. and the United Kingdom take a more conservative approach to the asset.Related: Around the World in 2019 — A Landmark Year for Crypto TaxationUse the guide above to understand the implications in your country. Keep in mind that a country may use one set of laws for individuals and another for businesses. For example, in Portugal, the laws are more advantageous for individuals.The rules can also differ from one business to another. In some countries, there are different tax rules for self-employers, companies, corporations and small businesses.In the U.S., when you receive virtual currency in exchange for performing services, whether you perform the services as an employee or not, you recognize ordinary income. For more information on compensation for services, see Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.Make sure you understand whether the current tax rules apply to your business. If you are not sure what rules apply to you, consult a local tax professional.You may be able to eliminate the volatility of cryptoThe volatility of crypto is an issue that affects everyone who ever considers paying with crypto, but if you have a business, you need to take a moment and think about the implications.There are two main ways to combat volatility. First, accept cryptocurrency payments through third-party service providers like BitPay.For a fee (as low as 1% in the U.S.), you can instantly get fiat whenever someone is paying you with crypto. Most of those companies are also taking care of the invoicing and record-keeping procedures and dealing with the mandatory Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements.Taxwise, this option is also very easy: If the crypto is immediately converted into fiat, you are paying tax for regular business income.The main disadvantage of these companies is that they cannot provide services to everyone. Depending on the type of company and your jurisdiction, you may not be eligible for these services.The second way to deal with volatility is to either accept stablecoins or instantly convert other cryptocurrencies to stablecoins.If you choose this way, you will need to issue the invoice for the payment yourself. There are some bookkeeping platforms that support crypto payments, such as Coinbase Commerce.Since stablecoins are not entirely nonvolatile, when you sell the stablecoins, you will need to check your tax implications, which depend on you and your business’s country of tax residency.Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get to the practical aspects.Record every saleThe first step is easier than you think. For every sale, you need to record the sale date and transaction amount as you would for fiat.If you use a service like BitPay that instantly converts 100% of the sale to fiat currency, then you are done. Record the final amount minus the transaction fee. Same as you would for a payment processor.If you do not use third-party payment services, in addition to the fiat amount, make sure to record fair market value amount in crypto. For reference, $50 USD at the time of writing this article is 0.0058 BTC.Fair market value, or FMV, is typically defined as the selling price for an item to which a buyer and seller can agree.Cryptocurrency value is determined by the cryptocurrency exchange and recorded in U.S. dollars. However, when it comes to peer-to-peer transactions or other transactions not facilitated by an exchange, the FMV is determined by the date and time at which the transaction was recorded on the blockchain.The amount of income you must report is the fair market value of the virtual currency in USD when received. In an on-chain transaction, you receive the virtual currency on the date and at the time the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger.Additionally, you will need to determine the cost basis for the crypto you have received.Cost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes. For digital currencies, the cost basis is the amount you spent to acquire the digital currency, including fees, brokerage commissions from exchanges, and other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars.If you provided someone with services and received digital currency in exchange, your basis in that digital currency is the fair market value of the digital currency in U.S. dollars when it is received. For more information on basis, see Publication 551, Basis of Assets.The Internal Revenue Code and regulations require taxpayers to maintain records that are sufficient to establish the positions taken on tax returns.For cryptocurrency payments, it means documenting receipts, sales, exchanges or other dispositions of digital currency as well as the fair market value of the digital currency at the time of transaction.Cashing outNow it’s time to “cash-out” into fiat. Because the BTC price fluctuates, each sale has a unique value in BTC.We send the 0.0269 BTC to an exchange and sell it for 290 USD. There is a 40 USD gain due to appreciation of the Bitcoin price.When you earn money between the time of sale and the crypto-fiat conversion, you probably need to pay capital gains tax.It depends on the country, but in the United States, we would calculate the time between the initial sale and the crypto-to-fiat conversion.In our example and most others, the crypto-to-fiat trade that occurred within 12 months of the crypto purchases will be considered short-term capital gains.If you decided to hold your crypto for over a year, then the profit would be considered long-term capital gains.Many people don’t know it, but cryptocurrency tax liability can be significantly reduced by crypto tax planning. The new IRS guidance enables you to plan your taxes by choosing which particular Bitcoin to sell.Related: New IRS Tax Guidance Targets Crypto, and US Persons Who Use ItTherefore, you can choose to sell the same Bitcoin you purchased when the price was high now at a lower price. This can assist you in optimizing your tax liability. This tax planning method calls for the use of specific identification, a common way to calculate and plan taxes in many countries.What about the miscellaneous transaction and withdrawal fees?This one is straightforward. They are considered expenses, just like traditional banking or processing fees. The fees will reduce your cost basis.What about crypto refunds?Let’s say a customer wants to return an item and is granted a full refund. Bitcoin has gone up since its purchase. Do we refund their original amount of Bitcoin or the current USD equivalent?This is usually a case-by-case decision, but most businesses will refund the USD equivalent at the time of purchase because the unit of account is (almost) always in fiat currency.No matter what you choose to do, make sure you report it correctly and reduce the tax calculation consistently. Keep all fair market value records of the payment receipts and the refund.We hope you have a bit more clarity on the tax implications for your business.

41891, Self-Proclaimed World’s Lightest Blockchain Rolls Out Phase Three of Its Testnet ,2020-03-25t13:14:00+00:00,3979,95,"A new cryptocurrency ecosystem claiming to be “the world’s lightest blockchain” has ostensibly grown to become one of the largest layer 1 testnets by peer count in the industry.Speaking Cointelegraph on March 24, the developers behind Coda Protocol said that phase three of the network’s testnet launch has now drawn over 400 users — with 300 users signing up to stake, and 143 maximum concurrent users.When compared with data from block explorers for other testnets — as well as anecdotal information from professional validators — Coda claims this peer count already makes it competitive with established testnets such as Celo, Solana, Cosmos, and Cardano.Privacy and low bytesThe Coda Protocol, created by software development firm O(1) Labs, uses recursive zk-SNARKs, or zero-knowledge proofs, to improve scalability and operate as a “tiny, portable” blockchain that can be downloaded on smartphones and browsers, or integrated into decentralized applications.As reported, zk-SNARKs are a cryptographic primitive that can sever any tractable piece of data between two parties over a public medium, such as a blockchain. They are therefore commonly used to enhance digital privacy for transactions using cryptocurrencies, as with the anonymity-focused altcoin Zcash (ZEC).Yet beyond their privacy potential, they are also, as Coda’s developers emphasize, extremely lightweight, and therefore well suited to lighten the overall data size of a given blockchain.The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain has a current blockchain size of roughly260,900 MB — with nodes needing to download the entire chain in order to verify that it is correct and reach consensus.Such resource-intensivity, Coda’s developers argue, places increasingly high barriers to entry for participant nodes, compromising decentralization and potentially rendering the network more vulnerable to a 51% attack. In trying to tackle this problem, they write:“What we’ve done with Coda is replace that whole transaction history with a lightweight, zero-knowledge proof (recursive zk-SNARKs), which is only about a kilobyte, or the size of a few tweets, so you only need to look at that small proof to know that the current state of the blockchain is correct.”In this view, the lighter a blockchain, the larger and more inclusive the pool of eligible validating nodes can be.Token distribution to incentivize community engagementAlongside its testnet launch, Coda has rolled out a token program called “Genesis,” distributing 6.6% of all tokens to founding members to prepare them to become block producers on the network. The team has reportedly already received 1,300 applicants wanting to join Genesis and has onboarded 40 founding members to its first cohort.Among these members is Libra Association founding member and blockchain infrastructure provider Bison Trails, as well as Figment Networks — a validator on the decentralized Ethereum-compatible network Skale."
41890, Retail Investors Can Now Use Paxos Gold as Collateral Against Loans ,2020-03-25t13:30:00+00:00,3380,74,"Crypto-lending platform Nexo has today, March 25, opened up the option of using PAX Gold (PAXG) as collateral against its loans to retail investors. A pilot scheme in late 2019 was limited to institutional clients and purportedly saw immediate demand for its gold-backed credit lines.Nexo’s announcement means that collateralized borrowing against high-grade gold is now no longer the preserve of the ultra-rich.Launched in September 2019, Paxos’ PAX Gold token is fully-backed by and redeemable for physical gold, stored in secure vaults.Each token represents one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery Gold, and enables ownership of gold as a safe-haven asset, with the added convenience afforded by tokenization.Pilot scheme prompts $5 million investmentNexo saw such demand for gold-backed credit from institutional clients during its pilot scheme that it invested in $5 million worth of PAXG to meet investors’ needs.The expansion of this pilot to include retail clients now allows anyone to leverage gold-backed PAXG assets as collateral on the Nexo platform. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of Nexo, explained the allure:“Especially in high-volatility times, as in the present, gold is sought after by many of our retail clients and we have worked towards reflecting their wishes.”As Cointelegraph reported, the crypto loans industry has seen solid growth, as many cryptocurrency holders prefer to leverage their assets as collateral rather than liquidate them."
41889," Fake Ledger Live Chrome Extension Stole 1.4M XRP, Researchers Claim ",2020-03-25t12:56:00+00:00,2946,116,"A fraudulent Google Chrome extension has allegedly stolen as much 1.4 million XRP from users this month alone.In a series of tweets published on March 24, the research team “xrplorer forensics” claimed that fake Ledger Live extensions are being used to collect user backup passphrases:“They are advertised in Google searches and use Google Docs for collecting data. Accounts are being emptied and we have seen more than 200K XRP being stolen the past month alone.”Revising this initial figure, xrplorer forensics later amended its estimate to “close to 1.4M.”The fraudulent extension is still available on Google StoreAccording to the researchers, most of the stolen XRP appears to still be held in accounts, with a proportion cashed out via the crypto exchange HitBTC.Sharing a screenshot of a post request from the alleged scam, xrplorer forensics warned the community against downloading tools for their hardware wallets from any developer other than the vendor directly — in this case, French crypto hardware wallet manufacturer, Ledger.Screenshot of the alleged Ledger Live XRP phishing scheme. Source: @xrpforensicsAs of press time, two ""Ledger Live"" extensions appear on the Google store for the Chrome browser, both of which include multiple user reviews that appear to corroborate xrplorer forensics’ warnings against the scam.Exchanges should be on the alertIn a series of parallel tweets between March 20 and March 25, xrplorer forensics claimed that close to 300 million XRP currently residing in XRP accounts is flagged as fraudulent.The vast majority of it, they claim, comes from the PlusToken exit scam. 13 million XRP is, in their estimation, derived from other thefts and scams.In a tweet today addressed to crypto exchange bithunter.io, the researchers asked why AML (anti-money-laundering) alerts were not observed for a series of large and allegedly suspicious transactions. They contend that one-third of all XRP bithunter has received is from suspect accounts on their advisory list.As of March 20, the researchers said they had been noticing a “consolidation of funds from various scams happening right now,” appealing to exchanges to stay alert to the nature of incoming payments.Repeat warningsAt the start of this month, Ledger had itself cautioned its users against the fake Ledger Live extension — first discovered by Harry Denley, director of security at blockchain interface platform MyCrypto. Denley, like xrplorer forensics, had identified that the fake extension was being propagated by a GoogleAds campaign."

These assets back the value of the Asia Reserve Currency Coin, or ARCC.The funding, according to an announcement on March 25, will come directly from Borderless Capital and other companies and coincides with the official listing of the ARCC token on BiKi Exchange — a company that currently has over two million registered users in Singapore.IBMR’s investment seed targeting Southeast AsiaThe announcement further adds that ARCC incentives participation in the ARCC.one microfinance asset management platform and is issued as an Algorand Standard Asset token, as Cointelegraph previously reported on December 12.Sinjin David Jung, founder and managing director at IBMR, stated that the mission of ARCC targets urban working poor of Southeast Asia to bring them socio-economic transparency and financial stability.As for the ARCC token listing, it will be included on BiKi Exchange on March 31, 2020.As Cointelegraph has previously reported, IBMR and blockchain firm Algorand partnered last December to jointly launch a microfinance platform dedicated to the ARCC token. The platform aims to provide debt-free capital to the urban poor in Asia, where 300 million adults do not have access to traditional financial institutions and instruments such as bank accounts or credit."
41887, Manual Trading Terminal Launched by Crypto Software Provider ,2020-03-25t12:16:00+00:00,1380,24,"A cloud-based crypto trading software provider has announced it is launching a manual trading terminal — enabling users to place orders on its interface as if they were using their usual exchange.TradeSanta says its latest product launch is particularly useful for crypto users who use multiple exchanges and rely on automated trading bots regularly. It is hoped that this feature will cut a step in the process and enable positions to be entered into more quickly, as traders will no longer have to visit their chosen exchange first.According to the company, this option ties in nicely with other features such as Smart Order, which paves the way for large amounts of crypto to be bought and sold without triggering dramatic fluctuations in the price of the asset in question.Making trading simplerTradeSanta says it is positioning itself as a service that enables traders to enjoy exposure to the market 24 hours a day, seven days a week — without the need to make trading a “full-time job” where they are never away from their screens.Six major exchanges — including Binance and Huobi — can be connected to the TradeSanta platform in a matter of minutes. Support for new platforms is constantly being added, and in-depth blog posts provide step-by-step instructions that explain how exchange accounts can be added to a user’s profile.More insights from TradeSanta hereUsers have the freedom to either use existing templates for trading bots or to devise their own tailor-made strategy from scratch. As well as the ability to transact large volumes without sending shockwaves through the market, users can take advantage of bull and bear markets by relying on long and short strategies — something that will undoubtedly prove useful given therecord levels of volatility that have been roiling the crypto markets of late.To protect gains, TradeSanta users can also establish take-profit targets that ensure deals are closed at an optimal moment. Bots can be configured to automatically sell a position at the desired level — eliminating the need for users to constantly monitor ups and downs in the marketplace. The company says that easy access to information is nothing short of vital, and that’s why a bot’s progress can be monitored from anywhere with an internet connection — with Telegram notifications sent directly to the user’s phone whenever a bot is in action.The technical indicators on offerA series of technical indicators are also on offer, helping users to configure their bot and time their entry into the market for maximum impact. Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (otherwise known as MACD, for short) allows users to follow momentum, detect strong trends and gauge whether price reversals should be anticipated. Meanwhile, a Relative Strength Index can be used to ascertain the magnitude of an asset’s recent price movements. Last but not least, TradeSanta bots can scour the market for an optimal entry point based on Bollinger bands for trading pairs — assessing the past 90 minutes in five-minute intervals.At the time of writing, TradeSanta says it has more than 28,000 active users — and more than 9,200 trading bots are currently in action. Overall, it is estimated that over 3 million deals have been successfully completed since the service launched.Learn more about TradeSantaDisclaimer.

Scott filed his motion to dismiss the case with the court last month.U.S. government rejects Scott’s appealThe government asserts, “It was entirely reasonable for the jury to conclude that the defendant knew that he was dealing with the proceeds of an unlawful activity.”“Legitimate investment funds whose transactions involve proceeds from lawful activities do not forge documents and create false records on a routine basis,” the memo asserts.The prosecution’s evidence included testimony from 17 witnesses including victims of the OneCoin scam, employees from U.S. banks allegedly deceived by Scott, government agents, and Konstantin Ignatov — a leading figure from the OneCoin scheme.Scott said the witnesses’ testimony was based on “innuendo and hearsay” and “was insufficient to support a conviction” on either charge, requesting that the court enter a judgment of acquittal on both counts.OneCoin operator disappeared in 2017Scott was charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering after being arrested in 2018.The indictment alleges that from September 2015 until 2018 Scott conspired to launder $400 million in proceeds for the OneCoin scheme after being introduced to its chief operator Ruja Ignatova — who disappeared in 2017.The scheme involved defrauding financial institutions located in numerous jurisdictions worldwide, with Scott setting up numerous accounts to move OneCoin’s proceeds under the guise of various investment funds."

They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!”While many have responded with shock and concern at what appears to be the president privileging economic health over public health, Ethereum co-founder and founder of Cardano Charles Hoskinson is not taking Trump’s commitments at face value. In a tweet posted on March 24, he wrote:“Here is my prediction. I could be totally wrong but I think Trump is actually going to shut down the country with a full quarantine at the end of his 15 day guidelines next week. The speculation about reopening is to prevent people from panicking or relocating.”Hoskinson’s forecast that America is en route to a full-on lockdown was met with some skepticism in the crypto community.One pointed to the president’s own vested interests to get the economy back up and running as soon as possible, while another said Hoskinson was crediting Trump with too much ingenuity.Former Democratic presidential hopeful and cryptocurrency advocate Andrew Yang tweeted his own view on March 24:“You know what will revive the economy? Suppressing and containing the virus. That’s it.”Earlier today, Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhang argued that the COVID-19 outbreak was likely to set a new bar for the cryptocurrency markets.The trillions involved in the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented stimulus package, he claimed, have made a $2 trillion Bitcoin (BTC) market cap with 1 BTC at $100,000 “no longer such a hard to imagine number.”"

The package, worth an estimated $6 trillion, followed the Federal Reserve embarking “unlimited” money printing.For multiple commentators, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, fiscal trends suggest that it would be even easier for Bitcoin to hit a $2 trillion market cap.Dan Held, director of business development at fellow exchange Kraken, added on Twitter:“$6,000,000,000,000 stimulus package for just one country.

41881, Vitalik Proposes Solution to 'Embarrassing' Lack of Bitcoin–Ethereum Bridge ,2020-03-25t11:24:00+00:00,9361,327,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin posted a tweet on March 24 claiming that the continuing lack of easy movement between the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks was embarrassing.As a solution, he proposed putting resources into building a decentralized exchange (DEX), to act as a trustless bridge between the two.DEX should be trustless, serverless and Uniswap-likeButerin’s plan calls for the DEX to be trustless and serverless, with a user experience very similar to Uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that runs without an order book, instead relying on asset pairs with Ether as a fixed base currency.As Cointelegraph reported, Uniswap has just announced plans to release a V2 update in Q2 2020, which will allow direct token-to-token swaps.Decentralized exchanges have struggled to gain market share against traditional exchanges, despite being more closely aligned to the overall trustless ethos of cryptocurrency. Part of the issue has been a lack of liquidity, although a dedicated Bitcoin–Ehereum DEX supported by Buterin may well see greater uptake.Building bridges not limited to BitcoinVitalin suggested further suggested that Bitcoin was not the only potential destination for a DEX bridge from Ethereum, and other blockchain ecosystems should also be up for consideration.Buterin specifically mentioned Zcash as one example, saying that he has already had discussions to this end with Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Zcash-creators, the Electric Coin Company. However, he admitted that they could both work harder to turn such talk into action."
41879, Australian Securities Exchange Delays Switch to Blockchain Due to COVID-19 ,2020-03-25t09:36:00+00:00,3413,111,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has once again delayed its transition to the blockchain, due in part to uncertainty around the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic.In an announcement published on March 25, ASX said it was replanning its blockchain implementation timetable in light of the unfolding crisis, as well as because of issues that were under consideration prior to the outbreak.In June, the exchange will therefore seek user input to establish a new go-live date — which until now had been set for April 2021.Pandemic-driven volatility takes its tollAs reported, the ASX has been developing blockchain infrastructure that will replace its current system for processing equity transactions — known as the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) — since December 2017.Having already delayed implementation before, the pandemic and its economic shockwaves now apparently place further strains on ASX’s development and readiness activities:“In recent days, ASX has received further feedback about the ability of users to focus on the CHESS replacement project during this period of heightened volatility and activity levels. With many firms in the industry, including ASX, operating with a large proportion of staff working from home, the ability to participate in coordinated readiness activities later this year is unclear.”By postponing the finalization of a new implementation timetable until June, ASX says it hopes to be in a position to better assess the implications of COVID-19 for its activities.Notably, the exchange indicates that even prior to the pandemic, its consultation with market users over the past three years on the functionality and timing of the CHESS replacement system has led to diverse feedback: some users have been advocating no delay, while others would like the project extended to give everyone more time to prepare.While CHESS replacement is being postponed, ASX says it remains committed to a target launch date of July 2020 for its opening of an Industry Test Environment (ITE) for developers.Concluding the announcement, the exchange’s deputy CEO Peter Hiom has said:“ASX remains fully committed to CHESS replacement. We continue to progress the project, including system development and testing, supporting back office software developers [....] the investments we are making in the new system and in distributed ledger technology are for the long-term benefit of the financial services industry and the Australian economy.”ASX’s blockchain advancementAs reported, ASX released the first code for its replacement app development tool based on blockchain technology in spring 2019 — a Customer Development Environment platform, developed in partnership with United States-based Digital Asset Holdings.In October, the Australian subsidiary of market operator Chi-X called on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate the possible effects of blockchain technology on trading activities.At the time, Chi-X Australia said it was concerned that the new blockchain CHESS replacement system would give ASX an unfair advantage and should be regulated, arguing that:“There’s a substantial moat around the ASX clearing and settlement business… And the CHESS replacement project is perhaps making it bigger.”"

According to Zhao, Bitcoin ride this wave all the way to $100,000:“As we get used to talk about Trillions, a modest $2 trillion market cap of #bitcoin will put 1 BTC at $100,000. Not such a hard to imagine number now, right?”Bitcoin price appreciation boosted by HODLersZhao went on to explain that, because most Bitcoin is in the hands of HODLers and not for sale, only a small percentage of the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package would need to flow into Bitcoin in order to achieve an equivalent market cap.Of course, Zhao’s bullishness for Bitcoin is swiftly becoming a meme, and many of his Twitter followers responded that such a prediction could only be a sell signal.

On March 13th, the aggregated transfer of all stablecoins that we track reached a new all-time high of $444.21M.”Other stablecoins also came out on top. Tether issued on Ethereum (USDT-ETH) had a large increase in market cap, which has reached $3.7 billion as of March 22.“The dual impact of Bitcoin’s USD value halving and massive issuance of stablecoins led to stablecoins’ market cap as a percentage of Bitcoin’s doubling in a matter of days.”Looking at stablecoins in a volatile marketUSDC was the winner of the crash in terms of market caps, with a 57% increase over the last thirty days.

The Tokyo-based association’s guidelines are its first attempt to help blockchain gaming developers avoid any indiscretions.The guidelines also address local laws covering Japan’s gaming industry, including the Law for Preventing Unjustifiable Extra or Unexpected Benefit and Misleading Representation, the Payment Services Act, and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.One of the goals is to make it clear to blockchain gaming developers what exactly is classified as gambling according to Japanese law.

41860," Telegram Denied: Court Sides With SEC, Grants Injunction Against Issuing GRAMs ",2020-03-24t22:25:00+00:00,8675,148,"A United States District Court has granted an injunction against Telegram, preventing the company from issuing its GRAM tokens at the present time.Court says that GRAMS are securities under Howey testPer a March 24 filing granting the Securities and Exchange Commission’s request for a preliminary injunction, the Court wrote that:“The Court finds that the SEC has shown a substantial likelihood of success in proving that the contracts and understandings at issue, including the sale of 2.9 billion Grams to 175 purchasers in exchange for $1.7 billion, are part of a larger scheme to distribute those Grams into a secondary public market, which would be supported by Telegram’s ongoing efforts. Considering the economic realities under the Howey test, the Court finds that, in the context of that scheme, the resale of Grams into the secondary public market would be an integral part of the sale of securities without a required registration statement.”The SEC and Telegram: A Hate StoryThe Telegram court case has been ongoing since October last year, following the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) for the Telegram Open Network (TON).As with many ICOs, the SEC has taken the stance that under the 1934 Howey Test, such offerings constitute the sale of unregistered securities.Telegram had held that since it filed a Form D 506(c) Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities prior to the first round of its offering, it was authorized to sell tokens to accredited investors.However, the Court noted in granting the injunction that since Telegram intended for the Gram tokens to reach the secondary market, disqualifying them from exemption:“Telegram’s sale of Grams to the Initial Purchasers, who will function as statutory underwriters, is the first step in an ongoing public distribution of securities and, as such, Telegram cannot receive the benefit of an exemption from the registration requirement under either section 4(a) or Rule 506(c).”In a sentence that may deliver a blow to many issuers of tokens through the ICO model, the Court rejected Telegram's argument that the Gram would become a commodity once actualized and therefore fell outside the purview of the SEC.""The Court rejects Telegram’s characterization of the purported security in this case. While helpful as a shorthand reference, the security in this case is not simply the Gram, which is little more than alphanumeric cryptographic sequence. Howey refers to an investment contract... that consists of the full set of contracts, expectations, and understandings centered on the sales and distribution of the Gram. Howey requires an examination of the entirety of the parties’ understandings and expectations.""Concluding that the court must stop the delivery of GRAM tokens, the filing reads:“The Court also finds that the delivery of Grams to the Initial Purchasers, who would resell them into the public market, represents a near certain risk of a future harm, namely the completion of a public distribution of a security without a registration statement. An injunction, prohibiting the delivery of Grams to the Initial Purchasers and thereby preventing the culmination of this ongoing violation, is appropriate and will be granted.”This is a breaking story and will be updated."

The Bank of China has completed development of the basic functions of the official digital currency and is now drafting laws that will help its implementation.The Global Times also mentioned a number of Shenzhen-based private companies including Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and China Merchants Bank have participated in the development of the digital currency.Cao Yan, managing director of Digital Renaissance Foundation, told the news agency that these private companies were selected based on their rich blockchain and third-party payments experiences.China has leveraged its advanced mobile payments companiesAlibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay together have more than 1.7 billion active accounts across China — 300 million more than the country’s population. They have blended social media, e-commerce and payments to create an advanced online commercial infrastructure.Alipay reportedly publicized five patents related to China's official digital currency between January 21 to March 17.The patents cover several areas of digital currency, including issuance, transaction recording, digital wallets, anonymous trading support and assistance in supervising and dealing with illegal accounts, industry media reported.China’s long term goal is to get ahead of the international economic development gameCao believes that accelerating the CBDC plan can help turn a crisis into an opportunity, as cryptocurrency is seen as the most convenient tool to translate a central bank's zero and negative interest rate policy into commercial banks. He added that:""If there is a chance China is considering lowering its interest rate into negative territory as an final option and directing such policy to commercial loans and lending, a circulated digital currency rather than M0 will be able to achieve that.""Cointelegraph previously reported on China’s plan to implement the digital Yuan among countries involved in its Belt and Road initiative.

It's solving a fundamental problem that we see in the decentralized exchange space.""Solana shoots for scalabilityCurrently a popular network choice for DApps, Ethereum’s blockchain became clogged in September 2019 amid an influx of Ethereum-based Tether (USDT) transactions.In late 2019, co-founder Vitalik Buterin came forward stating Ethereum's Istanbul fork would eventually support 3,000 transactions per second, or TPS. Solana reportedly touts almost 60,000 TPS.Solana, in general, is a layer-one blockchain solution that aims to provide high amounts of scaling without sharding. “We are scaling with hardware with Moore's Law,” Yakovenko said. “We’re like a non-sharded layer, one that’s ridiculously scaled.”The startup recently finished its Coinlist auctionSolana offered 8 million of its coins for sale in a Dutch-style Coinlist auction on March 23, touting a 90% price guarantee, Solana COO Raj Gokal told Cointelegraph. Noting current market volatility, Gokal explained Solana’s sale garnered surprising success. Solana’s auction sold off 1.6% of the project’s total 500,000,000 coin supply.“We cleared the auction at $0.22,” Gokal said.“Everyone gets the same price at the end,” he noted, explaining the process further. “The bids came in from anywhere between $4 and $0.04 in pre-bidding, and by the time the price got down to $0.22 — that was where there was enough demand to clear the 8 million tokens that were available.”Essentially, the market reached equilibrium with the available supply, settling on a price of $0.22 — equalling the highest price bidders were willing to pay, while still ensuring all 8 million coins would be sold.Solana garnered at least $1.76 million total from the coin auction, although, due to minor price increment issues, the total could be slightly higher, Gokal included.The startup approaches investor protection from a different angleYakovenko also explained Solana’s staking guarantee, built for sheltering early investors.Gokal said of Solana’s SOL coin:“It’s actually continuously redeemable for 90% of the auction clearing price, for 12 months — but the only way to register for this price guarantee is to actually stake your tokens. We have record on-chain of that registration, and then it requires continuous staking from the registration to the time that you want to redeem for that 90% price guarantee.”Solana’s guarantee looks to prevent early investors from getting burned on plummeting prices during the asset’s first year. Additionally, when the time comes for SOL’s listing on exchanges, buyers can still get the price guarantee if they buy the coins on exchanges, Gokal said.The price guarantee will “be accessible for the next year,” Gokal said, adding that “registrations will be accessible for the next three months, even on exchanges.”Touted as a regulatory-friendly digital asset sale platform, Coinlist itself tallied $9.2 million worth of investments as part of a funding round, Cointelegraph reported in April 2018.UPDATE March 24, 23:52 UTC: This article has been updated, correcting the total SOL coin supply from 500,000 to 500,000,000."

The TSSB highlights that fraudsters try to “capitalize on fear”, so the current coronavirus pandemic means they’re in their element.Regarding existing scam methods, the Texas state regulator warns the following:“Fraudulent investment offerings ranging from precious metals to real estate to complex stock market strategies are offered as a supposed hedge against stock market crashes or some other economic calamity.”Other US regulators such as the Commodities Futures Trading Commission hadissued alerts about fraudsters wanting to take advantage of the coronavirus contingency to profit from it.Cryptos considered as high-risk assets by the Texas watchdogIn the same notice, investors are advised to check theTexas Investor Guide 2020, which was previouslyreported by Cointelegraph on January 14.Cryptocurrencies were included in the report as one of the main threats to investors. The Texas state watchdog warned that crypto is a high-risk investment and requires careful scrutiny.Also, the Texas Investor Guide 2020 states that investors must determine some basic facts about the company they are dealing with, in addition to identifying their actual physical location before making business with them.Latest crypto scamsCointelegraph reported on March 20 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission froze the assets of Meta 1 Coin, an alleged crypto scam backed by a former state senator which promised investors high returns of up to 224,923%.Two Canadian nationals were also jailed in a U.S. federal prison on March 18 for stealing near 23.2 Bitcoins in a scam via Twitter during 2017."

Users then can pass the forms along to a tax professional or transfer to tax filing software for further processing.A response to crypto taxation around the worldThe new option comes in response to growing crypto adoption, as well as new requirements from regulators around the world making cryptocurrency owners report on their holdings. Thus, last summer, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began asking digital currency holders to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and interest and penalties.At the time, the IRS said that it was focused “on enforcing the law and helping taxpayers fully understand and meet their obligations."" Last October, the IRS issued its guidelines for crypto-based tax reporting, requiring roughly 150 million American taxpayers to answer the question whether they received, sold, sent or exchanged any virtual currency.At the same time, most members of the European Union have a radically different approach to tax codes to govern their respective crypto sectors. For example, in Germany, Bitcoin (BTC) is not subject to any capital gains tax, thereby allowing investors to avoid paying significant levies on their holdings if the value of their BTC appreciates."

This will help to assure that potentially manipulative practices are rooted out and suspicious behaviour detected.”Ardoino explained to Cointelegraph that “Shimmer processes the entire order and trade data and tries to find patterns for layering, spoofing and other manipulative practices.” He also said that, in order to avoid false positives due to high-frequency bot-based trading the system “can be taught to have different thresholds depending on the activity of the user.”Ardoino revealed that Bitfinex plans to make Shimmer open source in the future, but there’s no deadline for this yet. An exchange spokesperson also explained to Cointelegraph that when anomalous trading is detected the consequences will see the firm take different measures based on the severity of the activity.Market manipulation in cryptocurrency tradingBeing less regulated, the cryptocurrency market has long been accused of being much more vulnerable to manipulation than its traditional counterparts. For instance, in November 2019 research suggested that a single whale was responsible for Bitcoin’s historic price surge in 2017. Still, other sources later contradicted the theory."

Sygnum's ‘DCHF’ “settlement token” is backed 1:1 by funds held with the Swiss National Bank.According to local media outlet Swissinfo, DCHF is under consideration for support from the forthcoming SDX digital assets trading platform from SIX Group — of which Sygnum is a member.Swiss crypto bank announces CHF-pegged “settlement token”The crypto bank aims to target institutional clients with its stablecoin, emphasizing that the coin enables fast and frictionless settlements alongside novel financial applications.In addition to settlements, Sygnum’s Head of Tokenization Markus Hartmann asserts that the DCHF token can be used to execute smart contract payment structures — including “dividend pay-outs and other corporate actions.”Sygnum co-founder Mathias Imbach describes “trustworthy stablecoins"" as being ""of central importance for the development of the digital asset economy,” adding that the DCHF “creates considerable operational efficiencies and at the same time promotes the development of new business models.”Sygnum is first regulated bank to issue CHF-backed stablecoinsAs Sygnum has held a digital asset bank license with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) since August 2019, the firm claims to be the first licensed bank in Switzerland to issue a stablecoin.The crypto bank accepts deposits in fiat currencies including CHF, euros, Singaporean dollars and United States Dollars — all of which can be converted into DCHF via an internet banking portal.Sygnum customers can also purchase and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) among other crypto assets.The firm also holds a capital markets services license in Singapore.Competition heats up among CHF stablecoin projectsDespite claiming the title of the first regulated bank to issue a Swiss stablecoin, the firm is not the first to launch a CHF-pegged crypto asset.In 2018, Bitcoin Suisse AG founded the Swiss Crypto Tokens corporation to issue the first CHF-backed stablecoins. The Swiss Crypto Tokens comprise ERC-20 tokens that are redeemable for fiat currency in batches of $1,000 and are audited monthly.In June, SIX stock exchange requested that the Swiss central bank develop a stablecoin to increase the efficiency of settlements."
41846, Robinhood Looks to Win Back Users Angry Over System Outage on Historic Market Day ,2020-03-24t19:28:00+00:00,8181,93,"Crypto and trading app Robinhood has begun taking action to reconcile with users affected by technical problems that sidelined them during the biggest one-day point gain in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.On March 23, Robinhood reportedly emailed affected users to apologize for the incident and demonstrate its intention to rebuild customers’ trust in the form of credits, with the dollar amount to be determined on a case-by-case basis.Will users get reimbursement?A spokesperson for Robinhood told Cointelegraph that after reviewing customers’ emails and accounts, Robinhood indeed credited some of the affected customers.Specifically, Robinhood credited clients who are currently using its premium feature, Robinhood Gold, with three months of the “Gold” subscription free. The spokesperson further emphasized that not every person who has an account on the platform will receive compensation during the next few weeks on an individual basis. The firm plans to limit its credits to those who responded to the company and confirmed that they were affected by the incident.The company declined to comment on the total number of the affected users, as well as on the users outflow from the platform following the outage.Three crashes in two weeksAs Cointelegraph reported, on March 2, Robinhood experienced a day-long technical problem, with users being unable to complete their exchange orders or load their portfolio lists and charts.At the time, a spokesperson for the startup told Cointelegraph that the issue resulted in outages across many of its services, making users unable to use the company’s app, website, and help center. The spokesperson noted that the problem was not caused by a failure to code for leap year.Robinhood subsequently partially restored trading. That incident was, however, the first in a series of technical issues, which took place on March 9 and March 12. The outage of March 9 left the platform inoperable until 10:25 a.m. EDT, with services being restored at 3:30 p.m. EDT, less than 30 minutes before the markets closed. On March 12, users reported that Robinhood was down again.Users filed federal class lawsuit against RobinhoodFollowing the March 2 outage, one of the Robinhood’s users filed a federal class lawsuit on behalf of himself and other traders, on March 4. The plaintiff alleged that Robinhood breached its contract by failing to “provide a functioning platform,” causing traders to be unable to transfer money while stock markets surged.The platform’s customer agreement, however, explicitly states that it is not liable for “temporary interruptions in service due to maintenance, Website or App changes, or failures.”"
41843, United States CFTC Cements Parameters for Physical Delivery of Traded Crypto ,2020-03-24t18:55:00+00:00,2934,97,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, has publicized clarity on physical digital asset delivery as it applies to traded market products.“This announcement is meant to synthesize prior Commission guidance and enforcement actions as well as federal judicial precedent in this area,” CFTC Office of Public Affairs Director and Chief Communications Officer Michael Short told Cointelegraph in an email. “It is meant to reaffirm and illustrate the Commission’s approach.”“The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the Commission voted unanimously to approve final interpretive guidance concerning retail commodity transactions involving certain digital assets,” the Commission said in a statement provided to Cointelegraph, adding:“Specifically, the guidance clarifies the CFTC’s views regarding the ‘actual delivery’ exception to Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) in the context of digital assets that serve as a medium of exchange, colloquially known as ‘virtual currencies.’”Commodities trading in the mainstream involves physical deliveryIn traditional markets, when participants trade futures, they are betting on the future price action of an underlying asset. If they hold those futures all the way through settlement, they end up receiving the underlying asset, physically delivered to them.The CFTC’s new clarity involves a 28-day deadline for physical delivery, allowing the buyer to use their purchased digital asset after that period.The new guidance includes a person holding or controlling such a commodity, bought via leverage trading or other methods. He or she has “the ability to use the entire quantity of the commodity freely in commerce (away from any particular execution venue) no later than 28 days from the date of the transaction and at all times thereafter,” the Commision said.The offering party gives over ownershipThe CFTC included that the selling party and facilitator do not retain any ownership. The commission explained:“The offeror and counterparty seller (including any of their respective affiliates or other persons acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty seller on a similar basis) do not retain any interest in, legal right, or control over any of the commodity purchased on margin, leverage, or other financing arrangement at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the transaction.”Continued clarity from the CFTC shows the prevalence of digital asset trading in the mainstream world, spurring responsive regulatory guidance. Just this January, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, launched Bitcoin options trading. Such a product launch showed continued demand for trading Bitcoin after the outfit launched BTC futures in 2017.UPDATE March 20, 19:15 UTC: This article has been updated with comments Cointelegraph received from the CFTC’s Michael Short after initial publication."
41840, Crypto Conferences Finding Ways to Adapt Amid Coronavirus Pandemic ,2020-03-24t17:58:00+00:00,2579,98,"The number of coronavirus cases worldwide is rapidly getting close to 400,000, with many industries and businesses affected around the world. The crypto market has been no exception. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price initially reacted with a 50% drop; blockchain companies began to suggest that their employees working remotely; and crypto conferences have been either canceled or postponed.While some conferences report poor attendance and mass dropouts from panelists, others have found success in a virtual format. Crypto conference organizers and speakers shared with Cointelegraph the latest insights on what is happening right now within the blockchain events industry.How did it all begin?It all started back in February when organizers of major crypto conferences moved to cancel events in Asia in an attempt to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Among them were Hong Kong Blockchain Week 2020, Japan’s TEAMZ Blockchain Summit and Token2049 that were rescheduled for September and October.Two other major events — the Binance Blockchain Week Vietnam and TRON’s native summit — were canceled with new dates yet to be announced. Both organizers have already offered the participants a full refund or free VIP tickets.Until recently, participants of canceled events in Asia could attend crypto conferences in neighboring countries — now it’s almost impossible. Erhan Korhaliller, the organizer of Istanbul Blockchain Week, for instance, delayed the conference last week, although he previously proposed attending it as an alternative to canceled Asian conferences, citing low coronavirus infection numbers in Turkey.Many participants supported the organizer’s decision. Among them is Emre Tekisalp, the director of business development of O(1) Labs, the team behind Coda Protocol, who was invited to speak at the Istanbul Blockchain Week. He told Cointelegraph:“Most conferences have wisely placed the safety and health of participants above their own economic concerns.”In the United States, which has the third-highest number of people infected by COVID-19, organizers of crypto conferences have also had to change their plans. In particular, Bitcoin 2020, which was supposed to be held in San Francisco in March, has been rescheduled for the third quarter of 2020, and the DC Blockchain Summit has been canceled altogether, with new dates yet to be announced.Australia is also on the list. Adrian Przelozny, the CEO of crypto exchange Independent Reserve, shared with Cointelegraph that the APAC Blockchain Conference, which was initially scheduled for April 28–30, has been rescheduled for later dates.In general, the community reacted to the cancellation of conferences with understanding, albeit actively, as the users’ comments on the official Twitter page of the British Crypto Festival suggest.Overall, most blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related activities have been postponed to the second half of the year due to the current precarious situation around the world. Antonio Milio, the CEO and co-founder of Bitwings, a blockchain-based solution of the leading Spanish mobile operator Wings Mobile, told Cointelegraph that most crypto conferences have been postponed until the fall:“Over the past two weeks, about 10 conferences that I planned to visit have been canceled. Some of them were postponed to September–October, but there is no idea yet when the panic due to coronavirus will disappear.”First infectedOn March 15, Cointelegraph reported on the first coronavirus cases among the participants of the Ethereum Community Conference, which took place in Paris from March 3 to 5.To date 18 people have been diagnosed with the disease, including Afri Schoedon, the former lead manager of Parity; Jacques Dafflon, author of the ERC-777 token standard; Marco Correia from Gnosis; and Yong Zhen Yu, the co-founder of Torus, a decentralized authentication service. The latter wrote in a Twitter post that he also attended the ETHLondonUK conference, which, in turn, can potentially mean more attendees could be infected.All the participants of this event — over 600 people, including Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir and Joe Lubin — were also asked to take a coronavirus test.Conferences move onlineAgainst the background of disturbing reports, the organizers of one of the largest events in the crypto industry — Consensus 2020 — have decided to make the event virtual instead of canceling it. The online conference will be held in May, allowing attendees from all over the world to join for free. Additionally, the organizers have promised to give a refund to those who don’t want to participate online.Many participants have chosen to keep their tickets, though. For example, Eric Pitt, director of marketing for DigitalMint, a Bitcoin point-of-sale provider, told Cointelegraph that his team will take part in the virtual conference:“We're delighted to see that the conference will be adapted to a completely virtual format, rather than canceling the event. During a time when all industry gatherings are canceled, being able to participate in Consensus means a lot.”Another Consensus speaker, Will Reeves, has also confirmed his online participation to Cointelegraph:“I’m going to be a speaker at Consensus 2020, which has been re-formatted as a virtual event. In my view, it’s better for conferences to go virtual than to cancel or delay indefinitely.”After the EthCC 3 conference, some participants were diagnosed with COVID-19, while another event in Paris, Blockchain Week Summit, was postponed to December. Christophe Ozcan, one of the organizers of the Paris Blockchain Summit, which is scheduled for July 10, told Cointelegraph that his team is now considering switching to a virtual conference as well:“We have already scheduled the 3rd Paris Blockchain Summit on 10th July of 2020. At the moment, we are waiting to see how the coronavirus pandemic virus will be cured around the world and how the current situation is evolving. We are analyzing few other possibilities like making a virtual summit in case that the current situation still not evolve.”However, demand for such a format remains low, according to Ozcan, since the expectations are unknown for sponsors and attendees, adding: “It is slowly gaining momentum. If the pandemic is not contained early enough, we will likely see an increased interest in virtual crypto conferences.”Przelozny told Cointelegraph that despite many people liking the virtual format, the main attraction of attending conferences is to meet the delegates and speakers, which would no longer be an option: “It's not often that you have a possibility to meet so many of APAC's leaders in blockchain under the one roof.”Still, there are opposite points of view regarding the demand for the online format. Pradeep Atmaram, public relations officer at Persistence, the enterprise hub of Cosmos, believes that the demand for virtual events is growing significantly due to lower costs and higher limits on the number of participants.The project’s meetup, called Cosmos India, was scheduled for March 15 but, because of coronavirus fears, had to be moved online. According to Atmaram, Cosmos India managed to host over 60 participants and 10 speakers from across the globe instead of the initially confirmed 30 members and three speakers.Hsin-Ju Chuang, founder of Dystopia Labs, told Cointelegraph that the Trust-Less 2020: Proof of Stake Validator Summit, which was organized by her in February, was “a huge success.” She also explained that the online format may be a good option, given that many in real life conferences have lost their true value:“IMO, most IRL crypto conferences last year were poorly run; it was basically the same people traveling the world together; people were not going to IRL conferences to attend sessions and learn (they were flying out to network / do meetings).”Barbara Calderazzo, a representative of the communication team of blockchain project Interlogica, told Cointelegraph that the project managed to quickly respond to the coronavirus outbreak in Italy and moved its Bitcoin Venezia Meetup online.“Our Virtual Bitcoin Meetup is a live event, in many ways similar to the physical one. We first ‘aired’ on March 11 with a huge success: 200 people during the livestreaming is an unexpected result. [...] The attendants were very reactive and they asked several questions (through chat or ‘in person’) during the evening.”Additionally, blockchain companies are increasingly opting for online events amid intensifying coronavirus concerns. For example, Nodl, the project that develops the Lightning Network, initially planned to hold its own event during Bitcoin 2020 but is now considering the possibility of moving it online. The company has already conducted a survey among its users where 65% supported the initiative. Bitcoin Cash has also joined the list of projects moving its regular meetups online.New creative solutions are coming as virtual gatherings gain momentum. BitAngels has announced virtual events that feature startup pitches, keynotes and panels; BlockDown launched a two-day virtual crypto conference; and Bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer is apparently developing a virtual reality platform for crypto community meetups.Related: Stuck in Quarantine? Become a Blockchain Expert With These Online CoursesNevertheless, some feel reluctant to alter their plans, especially when it comes to other regions less affected by the pandemic. Among the examples is the Blockchain Africa Conference, which was held on March 11 and 12.However, some speakers opted-out of participating due to quarantine recommendations. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK, the company behind Cardano, told Cointelegraph that he decided to cancel his speech at the aforementioned Blockchain Africa Conference. He, instead, recorded a video of his presentation, which was subsequently shown at the conference.How will this affect the market?The coronavirus pandemic has already affected the price of cryptocurrencies in general and the activities of blockchain companies in particular. In March, Canaan, the leading manufacturer of mining equipment, left the Chinese market, while Coinbase, Waves, Binance and other large companies offered their employees the option to work remotely.A lot of project launches that were planned for this year will also be significantly impacted, according to Atmaram from Persistence, the enterprise hub of Cosmos, whose protocol launch in 2020 has been affected by the pandemic. He told Cointelegraph:“Coronavirus will pose difficulties for the community as a whole, and this might affect the timeline of the projects. Globally, this year crypto and blockchain adoption was predicted to boost. With this pandemic, progress has slowed down.”A lot of conferences that were planned around significant events, like the upcoming Bitcoin halving, have either been suspended or canceled. Consequently, this will impact the new wave of users coming into the ecosystem, as predicted by Atmaram.The cancellation of crypto conferences will, in turn, entail financial losses for the organizers and sponsors, according to Michael Garbade, the co-founder and CEO of Education Ecosystem, a decentralized learning ecosystem:“Remember, they [organizers] hired and paid employees for a job that wasn’t completed. It’s either they have to refund the participants’ money or postpone to a later date. [...] The cancellations affect the marketing efforts of the participants. They attend these conferences to market their products or services, but they can’t due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.”However, there are organizers who believe in finding a new approach amid the coronavirus outbreak and that it may bring even more benefits to their businesses. Sergey Voskolovich, part owner of DAO.Digital investors club, told Cointelegraph that although he made the Global Investors Virtual Summit free for everyone, the company won’t suffer financial losses:“We only take money for advanced options and participation in the investors' club. For those who want to present their project to investors to attract investment, the cost of participation has turned from $2,500 to $ 0. [...] In doing so, we will not suffer any losses. Because our summit will be several times more massive. And our losses will be more than compensated by advertising revenue.”In general, according to Evan Luthra, a Top 30 Under 30 tech entrepreneur and blockchain expert, what is happening in the world is providing new opportunities for participants in the crypto industry. In particular, he began releasing more online podcasts to talk to audiences. He told Cointelegraph:“Doing online events also makes it very easy for instant sharing with friends and is a great way to reach out to people who are working from home and usually wouldn’t have time to attend a conference. I do realize this affects a lot of stakeholders in a negative way, but we need to come together to help stop the spread of this dangerous virus which is already a pandemic and growing very fast.”"
41837, Forte Taps 5 New Gaming Partners as ‘Blockchain by Itself Isn’t Enough’ ,2020-03-24t17:19:00+00:00,3771,150,"Amid the increasing adoption of blockchain technology in the gaming industry, some of the world’s biggest game developers like South Korean Netmarble are partnering with blockchain gaming startup Forte Labs to streamline blockchain-powered game experiences.Forte, a known partner of major cryptocurrency firm Ripple, has just tapped five new high-profile gaming companies in line with its mission to provide best-in-class gaming experiences based on blockchain technology.All five new partners will integrate Forte’s blockchain platform into their gamesAccording to a March 24 blog post, Forte’s new game developers include United States-based Hi-Rez Studios and nWay, Canadian social games provider Magmic, German gaming firm DECA Games and Netmarble. The newly announced partners follow their previously joined collaborators, including Disruptor Beam, Other Ocean and Kongregate.Per the partnership, each of the five game developers will integrate Forte’s blockchain platform into one of its games, enabling new benefits for both developer and player communities, the firm announced to Cointelegraph. By using Forte’s blockchain, game devs can unlock new revenue streams by bridging the gap between digital gaming and physical collectibles and eventually providing real-world value to in-game experience.Forte believes that “blockchain technology by itself is not enough”While Forte sees blockchain as a tool for unlocking greater game experiences such as secure asset ownership and the ability to integrate peripheral markets, the firm is confident that sole blockchain integration doesn’t solve all gaming problems.“At Forte, we firmly believe that blockchain technology by itself is not enough,” the startup said, emphasizing that engaging player experiences must accompany tech advancement. According to the firm, that is the biggest reason behind the addition of new game partners.Josh Williams, Forte's co-founder and CEO, outlined that the new partners will bring deep knowledge in creating engaging game experiences that would be helpful in bringing blockchain-powered benefits to the mainstream. He continued:“Together, we'll work towards building a more open, equitable, and sustainable ecosystem that addresses many of the issues found today in the games industry.”To date, Forte's blockchain platform operates on an invite-only basis while the product is designed to be free and work across any game platform, the firm said. The platform is based on open source protocols like Ethereum and Interledger to facilitate the creation of game assets as well as cross-chain transactions.The news comes after Forte’s entrance into a major industry partnership with Ripple’s developer ecosystem project Xpring. On March 12, Forte and Xpring established a $100 million fund to support game developers and foster the mass adoption of blockchain technology in the gaming industry via boosting engagement and monetization tools."
41835, ‘Only Fools are Choosing Bitcoin’ Says Gold Bug Peter Schiff ,2020-03-24t16:59:00+00:00,9682,122,"“Only fools are choosing Bitcoin” over gold, according to renowned gold proponent Peter Schiff.In a March 24 tweet, Schiff expressed his negative view of the intellectual capabilities of Bitcoin (BTC) investors. He wrote:“Only fools are choosing Bitcoin. So far this year gold is up over 7%, while Bitcoin is down 3%. Gold is only 2% from its 2020 high, while Bitcoin is 35% below its 2020 high!”Schiff also pointed out that during the 2008 financial crisis, gold fell by about 25% and reached a new high in seven months. Based on that, he made his prediction:“During the 2008 financial crisis, gold fell about 25% and took 7 months to make a new high. This time gold only fell about 15%, and may make a new high in under a month. This shows how much greater this financial crisis is, and how much more reckless current Fed policy is.”“Bitcoin is still in a bear market”In another tweet, Schiff said that Bitcoin proponents are accusing him of ignoring the coin’s 12% gain on the day. He responded to them:“Bitcoin is still in a bear market. It's still down 35% from its 2020 high, and 3% YTD. In contrast, gold is in a bull market. It's only 2% below its 2020 high, and up 7% YTD.”It is worth mentioning that Schiff’s praise towards gold is well aligned with his personal interests. He is the chairman at Schiffgold, a precious metal dealer.As Cointelegraph has reported in the past, Schiff often attempts to convince his followers that Bitcoin is not a worthy investment. On March 10, Bitcoin surged to $8,150 before encountering resistance and being pushed back to $7,730 while most of the market was in a freefall. Shiff at the time ignored the fact and said:“Bitcoin is no longer a non-correlated asset. It's positively correlated to risk assets like equities, and negatively correlated to safe-haven assets like gold. When risk assets go down, Bitcoin goes down more. But when risk assets go up, Bitcoin goes up less. No value in that!”As of press time, Bitcoin is 6% up on the day as Wall Street opened in the green."
41832, Your Favorite Privacy-Minded Browser Is Teaming Up With Binance ,2020-03-24t15:56:00+00:00,5166,465,"Brave has partnered with Binance to bring in-browser crypto trading to its 13 million users. The Binance Widget allows Brave users to make crypto trades without leaving the browser.Branden Eich, CEO of Brave Software explained the rationale behind this partnership in an interview with Cointelegraph:“Our focus has always been on our users. This time, it’s about making crypto more usable by more people. We already have 1.6 million users who are crypto-savvy, they have signed up for the BAT Rewards Program; now they’ll be able to make crypto trades without leaving the browser”.Source: BraveThe Binance Widget will appear on Brave Nightly’s new tab. Nightly is a “testing and development” version of Brave that gets updated every night. The Binance wWidget will become available on the main version of the browser sometime in AprilUsers will be able to sign into the widget with their preexisting Binance account. For users in the US, Brave is partnering with Binance.US. Various regional affiliates of Binance will be available to Brave users around the world.According to Eich, the widget is mostly focused on trading and may be missing some of the more advanced features of Binance. But all the trading pairs available on the localized version of Binance will be available through the widget.Security and privacy remain central for Brave, the firm’s press release says:“Additionally, the Binance widget is built into Brave and is not a loaded iframe (remotely embedded document), which preserves the user's privacy. API calls will only be made into Binance if the user authenticates via OAuth and interacts with the widget.”This configuration also means that Brave does need to worry about Know Your Customer or Anti-Money Laundering compliance, relying instead on the partner exchange.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (‘CZ’) stated:“The Binance widget on Brave’s privacy-oriented browser instills a safer way to buy and sell crypto and also reduces user friction to onboard, trade and interact with the Binance ecosystem. We are looking forward to our long-term partnership with Brave to make it even easier to interact with crypto and encourage more utility in the near future.”Bravebook, Bravephone, Brave Messenger?The future is interesting here. Eich confirmed that Brave has looked into the possibility of extending Brave into other areas, like messaging and operating systems for smartphones and computers. However, for now, Brave is completely focused on the browser.Eich does not believe that we will see the fully decentralized internet anytime soon either, noting that blockchain-based VPNs like Brave’s VPN0 are more realistic.The announcement of this partnership coincides with reports of Google abandoning the release of Chrome M82 and shifting its development resources to M83 due to COVID-19.If Binance can capitalize on Brave’s vast userbase, this would lead to the influx of new liquidity to battered crypto markets."
41831, Why India Has the Potential to Lead the P2P Finance Revolution ,2020-03-24t16:00:00+00:00,3091,164,"India’s cryptocurrency ecosystem has been in limbo since the country’s central bank barred banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018. As of March 4, the Supreme Court of India has done away with those restrictions on crypto, allowing the second-most populous country — and the most populous democracy — a path to digital-currency freedom. The lifting of the ban by the Supreme Court will open new opportunities for India in terms of investments, the economy and the market as a whole.After the Reserve Bank of India restricted financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrency, trade volumes fell significantly overnight. Some, such as BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, believe this action created a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt. Because the average person did not have sufficient knowledge to start trading with alternative platforms other than peer-to-peer exchanges, the Indian population wound up becoming a leader in P2P trading.Related: India Back in the Race: Landmark Judgment to Fuel Crypto AdoptionAccording to recent data from Paxful, the people of India’s sentiment around digital currency prior to the lifting of the ban was quite contrary to that of their government. Trade volume on the peer-to-peer marketplace in January was over $3 million, while the number of transactions came in at over 23,500, representing an 11% month-over-month increase. The Indian people also highly favor bank transfers as a payment method, with over 76% of trades having occurred that way. A sizable amount of trades also took place with other methods based on the Unified Payments Interface system.Related: Supreme Court Post-Game: It’s a ‘Historic Day’ for Crypto in IndiaThe high use of digital currency, despite the lack of support from the government and national banking, shows that the people of India appreciate the benefits of cryptocurrency and desire additional resources that will bring them financial freedom. Now that the ban has been lifted, we can assume that, with the right support from the government and proper safeguards in place for the country’s 1.3 billion people, India holds the potential to become a crypto superpower.So, where does the potential to lead the peer-to-peer revolution come from, and why India?India has a population of over 1 billion people and already leads in traditional peer-to-peer lending that connects investors or lenders looking for high returns to creditworthy borrowers looking for short-term personal loans. The Indian population is quite familiar with operations that involve relying on your peers to drive financial inclusion and financial freedom. The inclusion provided by cryptocurrency will allow them to take that to the next level. Not to mention, the adoption of blockchain across India’s service sectors, such as banking, financial services, retail, supply chain and insurance industries, has the potential to add an extra $5 billion to the Indian economy.Related: A Call for Sensible Regulation: The Fate of Future Innovation in IndiaWith an evolving information technology sector and a service sector that is a key growth driver, India has no shortage of labor to enhance the technological advancements that go hand in hand with cryptocurrency and blockchain.

41830, Both Kik and SEC Seek Summary Judgement in $100 Mln ICO Case ,2020-03-24t15:45:00+00:00,1804,64,"Canadian messenger firm Kik is seeking pre-trial summary judgment in its legal dispute with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the company’s $100 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017.On March 20, Kik submitted a memorandum of law requesting the summary judgment from the court, asserting that the SEC had failed to demonstrate that its KIN tokens comprised unlicensed securities.Kik expects legal victory with summary judgmentReferring to its public sale as a token distribution event (TDE) rather than an ICO, Kik argues that its KIN tokens fail to meet two of the three requirements for a security as articulated in the ‘Howey Test’.Firstly, Kik argues that its TDE did not form a “common enterprise” between the company and the purchasers of its tokens — arguing that the terms of sale only obliged Kik to deliver the tokens and that it “had absolutely no control over the tokens” once issued.Kik also asserts that it exclusively promoted its Kin tokens as a medium of exchange rather than as an investment opportunity:“the SEC cannot show that Kin purchasers were led to expect profits from the essential managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Kik or others, as Howey requires. The undisputed facts show that Kik promoted Kin as a medium of exchange to be used in a new digital economy, not as an investment opportunity.”SEC claims ‘undisputed evidence’ that KIN are securitiesOn the same day, the SEC filed a request for summary judgment, claiming that it possesses “undisputed evidence” that Kik’s ICO distributed unlicensed securities.According to the SEC, Kik blatantly told investors that KIN prices increase alongside growing demand for the tokens — for which the issuer promised to “undertake crucial work to spur that demand.”“Kik’s 2017 offer and sale of Kin was an offer and sale of investment contracts to the public, which was not registered with the SEC, and for which there was no exemption from registration under the act,” the SEC argued.Both parties expect victory through pre-trial judgmentCuriously, both the SEC and Kik appear extremely confident that they will win the case in a summary judgment.While Kik believes that it only sold tokens to accredited investors and that its sale was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, the SEC describes the dispute as “a straightforward case in which Kik’s investment scheme and violations of Section 5 are easily identified.”"

Even the heads of DeFi companies seem unable to define the sector in a few sentences. So, here’s another attempt: DeFi is a financial ecosystem, in which it is possible to build tools, services and smart contracts and then bond them together on a blockchain, just like lego. It might not sound like fun, but it’s probably more useful.Lego might well be Denmark’s most famous export, but DeFi’s number one company, MakerDAO, is giving it a run for its money. Since the company was formed in 2015, it has rapidly grown to be the market leader in one of finance’s most exciting sectors. Cointelegraph caught up with MakerDAO’s European business development representative, Gustav Arentoft, about centralization and the company’s next move.MakerDAO on decentralizationFor many in the industry, DeFi and MakerDAO are synonymous. However, that does not mean that the company attracts only slavish adulation. For better or worse, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are philosophically driven. For many investors, decentralization is the most important principle, to which companies and currencies must adhere.Arentoft explained that, on the business side, universally applying decentralization across all use cases is not necessarily a recipe for success. He explained his feelings about the company being described as a decentralized central bank by fellow blockchain bankers Bitwala:“MakerDAO definitely shares a lot of similarities to the banking system. It can be looked at just like a community-driven central bank. We don't label ourselves as a central bank. But we do, of course, share a lot of similarities with traditional finance.”Arentoft believes that some of the activities performed in the company’s system are very similar to what a central bank would do in a traditional finance setting, adding:“So, in that sense, I don't believe that we have reinvented the way that we do finance. We're just doing it in a different way where we utilize the transparency and openness of the blockchain and the effectiveness of, for example, smart contracts to be able to execute specific tasks. This system is kind of like where we replace some of the traditional methods of doing things and thereby heightening efficiency.”Although DeFi is by definition decentralized, Arentoft said that elements of centralization can actually be beneficial to projects in early stages:“I think there's two sides to the question. In direct retail offering, is centralization acceptable there? And then, at the protocol level, where, for example, we are taking the approach of gradual decentralization. And one of the reasons for that is also that initially, when you build a product, when you're bootstrapping the ecosystem and you actually have a developer team sitting and building the protocol, you cannot be decentralized, because you literally have a team sitting somewhere building it.”For Arentoft, the prime justification for gradually decentralizing as the project grows is increasing the level of security. Although DeFi, through the flexible nature of its financial ecosystem, is inherently more driven by cooperation than other aspects of the cryptocurrency sectors, this does not mean cut-throat acts of corporate aggression do not take place:“There are a lot of things that you need to do over time because if you release something that is completely decentralized from day one, you also open up for a lot of attack vectors in the system. A good example is what happened with Steemit.”Arentoft explained that, at MakerDAO, the thorny question of centralization is not solved by adopting a binary position, arguing that flexibility offers more maneuverability for varied use cases:“What we are building is going to be this public infrastructure that really can sit and supply infrastructure and has possibilities for a lot of fabrication applications on top of it. So, we believe it should be decentralized, but it's something that needs to happen over time. I don't personally believe that it’s binary in the sense that you are either decentralized or you're like traditional finance. I believe that, on the spectrum, there's space for a lot of different uses.”Expanding decentralization across continentsWhile some aspects of crypto finance can be a hard sell for those in mainstream finance, recent years have seen more of an overlap than ever before. The “Libra” moment was not only unique due to its remarkable impact on the markets but also because it shined a light on how decentralized finance could be rolled out effectively to a huge number of prospective customers around the world.While a lot of crypto activity takes place in the United States and Europe, MakerDAO’s customer base is spread widely around the world and seems to be still growing. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic put the world on lockdown, Arentoft had planned to visit Africa and Asia. Furthermore, MakerDAO also has a foothold in South America, with a strong following in Argentina.While MakerDAO may currently be the market leader, Arentoft told Cointelegraph that the firm is continually looking to expand into emerging economies, where the lack of traditional financial services and infrastructure and the high proportion of customers with smartphones are a fertile environment for DeFi projects:“We need to expand the target market. So, that's why we've been doing a lot of projects where we focus on emerging economies where Dai and the DSR make a lot of sense. We can go in and we can take people who have limited access to financial services or might not have trust in the local systems. And it leapfrogs them all of a sudden to being on a crypto platform because this just provides a better service for them.”For many crypto finance projects using stablecoins, there are three target markets. The first is China, where the gigantic domestic payments industry is dominated by a few centralized companies. MakerDAO has already made significant in-roads in China, with a $24.7 million MKR token sale with Dragonfly Capital Partners in December last year. The second is Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on the Philippines where poor infrastructure and a steady flow of remittances from migrant workers provide excellent use cases for DeFi:“There are these guys we've worked with in Southeast Asia. We've been working with them for a little more than a year now. And they basically want to provide financial services via DAI in a digital wallet for their Southeast Asian community. So, when we started talking with them, we had 10 or 20,000 people on the platform. And now before we have even launched the full services, we have more than 600,000 people pass through KYC processes on the platform, using partnerships with several pretty big, major players in that region as well.”The third market is the African continent where a combination of low trust in institutions and a severely underdeveloped financial infrastructure are commonplace. Africa appears to be something of a golden goose for many of the biggest crypto projects.Related: Blockchain Africa Conference: Education Is Key Crypto Adoption DriverFacebook’s Libra project targeted the continent, and Jack Dorsey’s Square Crypto payments has a keen interest in exploring the African market. Dorsey even announced that he would spend significant parts of the year in Africa to better learn how to make a meaningful impact with cryptocurrency-enabled payments. Arentoft told Cointelegraph that Nigeria is the first market that MakerDAO wants to explore."
41825," UPDATED: In US COVID-19 Stimulus Bill, Hope not Lost for Digital Dollar ",2020-03-24t15:16:00+00:00,27359,428,"While the newest version of a proposed stimulus package to respond to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirusin the United States has scrapped mention of adigital dollar, at least one senator is fighting to keep those provisions.The changed bill for economic recoveryAs Cointelegraph reported yesterday, March 23, a draft of the proposed economic stimulus bill was circulating that included the requirement of developing a digital dollar. The provisions further stipulated that all banks party to the Federal Reserve would need to host digital dollar wallets — all measures to expand economic inclusion.Late last night, Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives introduced an updated “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.” This new version of the bill clocks in at over 1,400 pages — but with all mention of a digital dollar stripped.The continued role of the digital dollar:House sideWhile other Democrats in the House removed the digital dollar from their longer stimulus bill, members of the House Financial Services Committee led by California Rep. Maxine Watersput forward related legislation on March 23 that resolutely maintained the requirement to implement digital dollars to send aid.Per the announcement of the legislation, Waters maintained the importance of the 269 pages of supplementary measures:“As elected officials, it is our duty to ensure our nation’s workers, consumers, investors and the economy are equipped with the necessary resources to endure this unprecedented crisis, which is why I am calling on House and Senate leadership to include these critical pieces of legislation in the impending stimulus package.”Senate sideAt least one senator is fighting to keep a digital dollar in the Senate version of the stimulus package. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, released a bill almost identical to the provisions missing from the newest bill to appear in the House.In announcing the bill, Brown called upon his colleagues not just to consider it as self-standing legislationbut to include it within the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.” He said:“My legislation would allow every American to set up a free bank account so they don’t have to rely on expensive check cashers to access their hard-earned money.”Brown’s announcement for the bill said it would “allow everyone to set up a digital dollar wallet, called a ‘FedAccount,’ a free bank account that can be used to receive money, make payments, and take out cash.” These FedAccounts would be accessible at local banks and post offices.Sen. Sherrod Brown and cryptoCointelegraph’s readers may remember Sen. Brown from his role in the hearings on Facebook’s Libra before the Senate Banking Committee back in July.At the time, Brown was highly critical of Libra’s effortsbut did express broader interest in the role of digital payments.March 24, 17:30 UTC: This article has been updated to include new legislation introduced in the House Financial Services Committee."

41819, YouTube Scam Impersonates Ripple CEO Garlinghouse for Fake XRP Airdrop ,2020-03-24t14:02:00+00:00,4208,113,"Despite YouTube’s many aggressive actions against cryptocurrency-related content, the world’s most popular video-hosting website is apparently having trouble discovering a major scam account involving crypto.On March 23, the crypto community spotted a bogus YouTube account impersonating Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of major blockchain company Ripple, in order to promote a fake airdrop scam.Video containing fake XRP airdrop description was uploaded on YouTube on March 19The apparent scam account has around 277,000 subscribers and contains only one video, which promotes a fake giveaway in the third-biggest cryptocurrency, XRP. Uploaded on YouTube on March 19, the video description promotes a nonexistent airdrop of 50 million XRP tokens and has amassed over 85,000 views as of press time.While the video itself is not fake and is a real interview that Garlinghouse gave in February 2020, the scam lies in the video description. The Ripple exec hasn’t yet reacted to the scam alert on Twitter so far despite reports mentioning him.Fake XRP giveaway promotion on Youtube. Source: YouTubeSpecifically, the video description presents users with a bogus airdrop contest taking place from March 20 till March 25, according to the video description. The YouTube scammer asks users to send between 2,000 XRP to 500,000 XRP in order to “participate” in exchange for immediate airdrop of 20,000 to 5 million XRP. For example, the fraudster promises to send 2.5 million XRP back in exchange for sending 250,000 XRP ($40,000) to his/her crypto address. As of press time, the address has 5,135 XRP ($800).Scammers purchasing YouTube channels with large numbers of subscribers could be a reasonA co-founder of crypto podcast SPQR Media, who first reported on the YouTube scam on his Twitter account on March 23, emphasized in a recent tweet that the scam channel is still up and running and is receiving funding for promotion on YouTube. Twitter user @Andy_SPQR told Cointelegraph that he noticed the scam page last night as an ad popped up on his YouTube feed.The SPQR co-founder highlighted that he immediately tweeted to report on the apparent scam as the YouTube account had a “huge number of subs but only one video,” while the description promised a free XRP airdrop scam. According to the executive, the reason for the scam is that YouTube allows users to purchase channels from each other. He said:“In my opinion I think what’s happening is these scammers are purchasing YouTube channels with large numbers of subscribers and then deleting all content and uploading that video. I think that’s how they are able to maintain a presence on YouTube.”YouTube started an apparent crypto war in late 2019The news comes on the heels of YouTube continuing its apparent war against crypto content makers on the platform.As Cointelegraph reported on March 10, YouTube deleted another batch of crypto-related videos from two separate crypto channels. In late 2019, YouTube was also aggressively deleting crypto content from some of the biggest players in the industry. As reported by Cointelegraph, YouTube subsequently admitted that some of its deletions were a mistake, while a lot of crypto YouTubers expressed intention to move to blockchain-based video hosting platforms to share their content."
41818, Russian Ministry Wants to Test Crypto and Blockchain in Regulatory Sandboxes ,2020-03-24t13:59:00+00:00,2405,266,"Amid regulatory uncertainty for cryptocurrencies in Russia, a federal ministry introduced legislation that would legalize crypto and blockchain within a special regulatory environment.The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation has reportedly prepared a draft law that would allow the testing of cryptocurrency and blockchain developments within a special regulatory sandbox.Sandbox to unlock blockchain and crypto testing in eight industriesAccording to a March 24 report by local news agency Izvestia, the draft law was introduced to the State Duma — the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia — on March 17.Izvestia reports that the experimental law would pertain to digital technologies incorporated in eight industries including healthcare, financial markets, trade, transport, distance learning, construction, manufacturing and government services.The draft law would unlock experimental testing of projects like unmanned vehicles, remote diagnostics as well as personal data usage without written consent.The central bank of Russia would regulate the sandboxAs reported, crypto and blockchain participants of the regulatory sandbox would be granted regulatory relief regarding the minimum size of capital, reserve funds and reporting. Sandbox users would be exempt from the country’s foreign exchange law, the report notes.According to the Ministry, the Bank of Russia — the country’s central bank — will act as a financial market regulator within the regulatory sandbox. The bank has declined to comment to Izvestia whether it supports the Ministry’s initiative.The news comes shortly after a legal executive at the Bank of Russia declared that the country’s digital assets legislation will ban the issuance and circulation of crypto. According to the official, Russia’s bill “On Digital Financial Assets” would prohibit nearly everything about crypto except holding. As reported by Cointelegraph, the bill was delayed multiple ties after first being introduced in January 2018. President Vladimir Putin has ordered the immediate adoption of the bill two times since its inception to no avail."
41816, Uniswap V2 Offers Better Price Feeds and Doubles Down on Flash Loan Concept ,2020-03-24t13:14:00+00:00,1696,90,"The Uniswap decentralized exchange announced on March 23 a planned release of its second major version, Uniswap V2. Among the major features, the new platform will feature flash swaps — a similar feature to the infamous flash loans that some blame for recent decentralized finance (DeFi) hacks.The update’s release is tentatively scheduled for Q2 2020, though Uniswap’s blog post stresses that it is “not an announced release date.”Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform that offers similar functionality to ShapeShift or Bancor. Unlike traditional decentralized exchanges, there is no order book. Trades rely on asset pairs where Ether (ETH) is always the base currency.Uniswap V2 will allow direct token-to-token swaps, which is especially useful for swapping one U.S. dollar stablecoin for another. While this can be done right now by routing through ETH, a direct exchange reduces losses from fees and slippage.Preventing DeFi oracle bugsUniswap was at the center of two back-to-back exploits conducted on the bZx platform. One of the reasons why the second hack was possible was bZx relying on Uniswap and Kyber as price oracles — despite their relatively low liquidity.Uniswap V2 attempts to partially fix this issue by creating a time-averaged price feed. In order to influence the price values relayed by the platform, the attacker would need to affect at least two blocks in direct succession.This design is said to prevent attacks based on flash loans, according to Vitalik Buterin, as the flash-lent funds can only exist for one block. Taking the time average of the prices also makes the protocol more resistant to any kind of manipulation in general.Adding flash funding of its ownFlash loans were generally blamed for the hacks, despite the fact that many commentators pointed to critical vulnerabilities in bZx software. Despite their bad reputation, Uniswap V2 will feature a funding feature dubbed flash swap.The swap allows users to withdraw an unlimited amount of ERC-20 tokens from a liquidity pool, provided that in the same block, either the tokens or their ETH equivalent are returned.The feature would allow capital-less DeFi arbitrage — where traders play on the price difference of the same asset between various platforms. It could also make acquiring leverage through Maker (MKR) more efficient.The lending platform is currently used by some traders to enter leveraged Ether positions by recursively purchasing ETH with the Dai (DAI) minted by the system.With the flash swap, the desired leverage can be reached by simply borrowing ETH from Uniswap and returning it as DAI from Maker. While it simplifies the process, it does not make it risk-free as Maker suffered unfair liquidations recently."
41814, Alipay Patents Reveal More Details About China's Forthcoming CBDC ,2020-03-24t12:42:00+00:00,3798,142,"In the past month, Chinese payments platform Alipay has disclosed a number of patents relating to and revealing more details of China’s planned central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan.According to a report in local media outlet Interchain Pulse on March 23, Alipay is set to play an integral part in the major functions of the currency when it is launched.Alipay to be a secondary issuer of China’s CBDCThe first patent, published Feb. 21, revealed that Alipay is likely to be involved as a third-party operating agent in secondary issuance of the currency. This would put Alipay on an equal footing with commercial banks, who will not have a secondary monopoly on digital currency.However, the most important revelation is of how the digital currency can be traced, needing the functionality of a blockchain-based currency, despite not relying on blockchain technology itself.Transactions will be split into execution instructions corresponding to each party, along with an execution priority for each instruction. Instructions are then sorted and executed in order. By following the sorted execution instruction list back, transactions can be traced back for the entire life cycle of the CBDC.A related patent, published Feb. 28, details front-end encryption machines, deployed by the central bank with secondary issuers of the currency. These would monitor secondary issuance and transactions, and be roughly analogous to a node for a blockchain.Accounts suspected of illegal activity can be restrictedOn Feb. 25, Alipay published a patent detailing “a method and device for controlling digital currency accounts.”The regulator will provide a control device installed at the operating agency, with which supervisors can restrict suspected accounts within predefined rules. This will allow the supervisors to circumvent the need to go through the operator, allowing immediate restriction.Restrictions that can be applied include blocking one or more account operating authorities, prohibiting currency flows into and/or out of the target account, and freezing all funds held in the account.Wallet functionality will depend on behavior and personal dataAnother Alipay patent published on Feb. 28, states that there will be several different types of digital currency wallet, each providing different services, and specifies a method to identify which type a user has.It suggests that this can be ascertained based on two results, depending on the user’s behavioral data and provided identity data.In the patent, behavioral data is specified as the frequency of use, amount and venue of transactions. As Cointelegraph reported, Chinese citizens’ behavior is already monitored outside of CBDC use in everyday life, creating a “social score” allowing certain privileges and freedoms. It is currently unclear whether this behavior will also feed into the user’s wallet type.Identity information listed ranges from ID cards, bank cards and mobile phone numbers to biometric data such as fingerprints, bite marks and DNA.China’s CBDC could support “anonymous” transactionsIf the previous patents suggest a heavy-handed overview, monitoring and control of the whole CBDC ecosystem, a patent Alipay published March 17 states that it will support anonymous transactions.However, its method for doing so involves setting up “anonymous” wallets, which still require general information like a mobile phone number and email address.While this may provide a quasi-anonymous transaction method, it is unlikely that these are completely untraceable.Interestingly, the currency does not just deal in figures like current electronic transactions, but is the digitization of specific banknotes. So for example, a wallet would not just have a balance of 250 yuan, but would hold one note of 100 yuan, and 3 notes of 50 yuan."
41813, Mt. Gox Creditors to Meet Tomorrow As Reimbursement Process Inches Forward ,2020-03-24t11:42:00+00:00,3908,82,"In the latest sign of a step forward in a lengthy compensation process, the infamous hacked Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Mt. Gox appears to be hosting a new meeting for its creditors tomorrow, March 25.In an official announcement posted to the now-defunct exchange’s website on March 24, Mt. Gox’s rehabilitation trustee notified creditors of a new portal through which they will be able to access all documents to be distributed at tomorrow’s meeting.As previously reported, as many as 24,000 creditors are thought to have been affected by Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox’s 2011 hack and later collapse in early 2014, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC valued at roughly $460 million at the time.Reimbursement of the exchange’s creditors is being handled under the stewardship of Tokyo attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, who was appointed by a Japanese court to act as the civil rehabilitation trustee to manage Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy estate.Six years and countingToday’s announcement is scant on details as to what will be discussed tomorrow, which will be the fourth creditors’ meeting so far in civil rehabilitation proceedings for the former exchange.The lengthy reimbursement process — ongoing six years after the exchange’s collapse — has galvanized creditors and other community members to self-organize in an attempt to quicken matters. Their coordinated legal action succeeded in securing Mt. Gox’s transition from bankruptcy proceedings to civil rehabilitation back in June 2018.Civil rehabilitation should ensure that creditors are reimbursed in crypto, rather than in fiat currency equivalent to the value of their Bitcoin holdings at the time of the exchange’s collapse.The long-winded process has spurred some investors to repeatedly attempt to buy up creditors’ claims — as, for example, private equity and hedge fund manager Fortress Investment Group, which increased its offer last month to 88% of the estimated lost value.Michael Hourigan, a managing director at Fortress, said this February that the buyout offer was calculated according to “the likely timeline (3 to 5 years) and financial risk of the ongoing litigations.”Law firm Zheleznikov and Partners has recently claimed that it could recover up to 200,000 of the Bitcoin lost in the exchange’s hack by taking legal action against Russian nationals who allegedly hold the stolen money.In parallel, Mt. Gox’s former CEO Mark Karpeles remains mired in a legal battle over the nature of his role and culpability in the exchange fiasco."
41812, ZenGo Warns of Major Security Flaw Among DApp Wallets ,2020-03-24t11:35:00+00:00,1617,77,"Cryptocurrency wallet provider ZenGo has built a testnet to demonstrate a major security flaw prevalent among decentralized application (DApp) wallets.On March 23, ZenGo published an article highlighting that, when authorizing a specific transaction, many DApp wallets actually grant access over all of that particular token stored in the connected wallet:“As a result, if the DApp is vulnerable to a security issue or is rogue to begin with, attackers can abuse these highly excessive privileges to steal ALL of the DApp’s users holdings (in the approved tokens) without any further user consent. They can do so at any point in the future, even if the user no longer uses the DApp.”ZenGo builds testnet to demonstrate vulnerabilityZenGo said that “almost every DApp” exhibits the vulnerability, resulting in users unwittingly providing DApp smart contracts full control over their funds.To demonstrate the vulnerability, ZenGo has launched a public testnet featuring a “rogue” token swapping DApp dubbed baDAPProve.When a user authorizes a transaction of a specific number of FRT tokens on the testnet, baDAPProve will drain the users’ entire FRT wallet — emphasizing the risks associated with the vulnerability.ZenGo is currently developing a solution intended to fix the security issue.Despite the vulnerability having been identified several years ago, ZenGo believes that wallet providers are not doing enough to ensure that users are aware of the security risks associated with authorizing DApps to access their wallets.The firm claims that popular wallets Opera, Imtoken and Trust wallet do not offer any warnings identifying the security risk. However, Trust wallet indicated it will upgrade their wallet after being contacted by ZenGo.ZenGo found that the wallets offered by Brave and Metamask provide users with advanced settings that allow them to choose the sum that a DApp is able is to access, while Coinbase provides a warning to users emphasizing the risks.Wallet vulnerability unacceptable as decentralized finance growsZenGo also identified that even if a user no longer uses a DApp, the smart contract is still able to access their tokens as a result of previously granted permission.While ZenGo concedes that certain security compromises “might have been acceptable in the era when users were scarce and highly technical,” the firm argues that the increasing popularity of decentralized finance protocols necessitate security upgrades as it attracts a growing number of non-technical users.Cointelegraph has reached out to several of the aforementioned wallets but has not received a comment as of press time."
41811, Blockchain Africa Conference: Education Is Key Crypto Adoption Driver ,2020-03-24t11:28:00+00:00,1262,118,"Cryptocurrencies have seemingly taken a backseat due to a concerted focus on blockchain technology in Africa, but there is still a growing interest and demand for trading on the continent. This was one of the main takeaways from the Blockchain Africa conference held in Johannesburg in the middle of March 2020.The Blockchain Africa conference, which is the biggest in the continent, has become heavily focused on the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and far less so on the crypto trading space. It is a fact that was admitted by event MC Tanya Knowles, who recently became Binance South Africa’s country manager.It is difficult to get an actual gauge of the volume of cryptocurrency trading and use in Africa due to the seemingly small amount of exchanges across the continent. Nevertheless, a handful of South Africa’s biggest local cryptocurrency exchanges were present at the conference, including AltCoinTrader, Valr and Luno, the latter operating around the world.Binance, one of the world’s largest exchanges by trade volume, has also launched trading support for South African Rands, making the announcement during the Blockchain Africa conference. Binance currently has trading support in 35 African countries, which suggests that there is a growing demand for cryptocurrency trading platforms across the continent.Shifting the focus back to BitcoinRenowned cryptocurrency trader and analyst Tone Vays was one of the keynote speakers that attended the Blockchain Africa conference in Johannesburg. He was also one of just a handful of people that spoke about cryptocurrency trading and Bitcoin in particular.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Vays speculated that many people are still skeptical about the use of cryptocurrencies, which has resulted in a move away from the subject and a focus on the underlying technology:“There’s a couple of reasons and I think the main reason is around regulation. Bitcoin still sounds bad, everyone is still scared of Bitcoin and they think that it is only used for illicit purchases and blockchain sounds more appealing to the regulators, government entities and businesses.”Having spent some time speaking to the local cryptocurrency exchange owners that had setup exhibitions at the conference, Vays admitted that he was pleasantly surprised by the interest shown in trading in South Africa:“I think you guys are the leaders in Bitcoin and anything crypto in the African continent altogether. It might not be crazy to say that all the Bitcoin and crypto activity in South Africa is probably bigger than all the other African countries combined.”While the local players are still small-scale, Vays said that Binance’s move into the South African space should be a good thing for crypto traders in the country and the continent:“That’s actually big — Binance offering a Bitcoin-Rand trading pair. It’s important because the Bitcoin in South Africa is trading at a 6-8 percent premium. So with someone like Binance coming in, they have liquidity and as long as they can handle the KYC situation if they can lower that premium it does create a more efficient market. I’m sure it’s frustrating for people to pay 8 percent higher than the spot price.”Vays was also fairly critical of the shift in focus from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to blockchain. Vays maintains that Bitcoin can be useful to businesses, but said that the creation of knock-off blockchain platforms with native tokens does not necessarily add value. It’s part of the reason why he believes that blockchain conferences might not be commonplace in a few years’ time:“If you’re working on supply chains, there will be a supply chain conference, if you’re working on healthcare there will be healthcare conferences. There are conferences for every field, but blockchain is not a field. There are no internet conferences, it’s a question of how do you utilize the latest tools of the internet in your business.”Tough times not helping crypto tradersCointelegraph spoke to Richard de Sousa, founder and CEO of local cryptocurrency exchange AltCoinTrader, to get a sense of the appetite for trading in South Africa. De Sousa estimated that the platform currently caters to around 500,000 users that are actively trading, with 90% of them being South Africans. He also mentioned that they have some users from as far afield as Russia and the United States.Speaking from a South African perspective, De Sousa believes that the current economic climate has not made things easy for crypto traders. Nevertheless, he maintains that there is a healthy interest and participation from local traders, saying, “I think that a lot of people underestimate the trading community in South Africa.” He then added:“However what we have seen in the last two to three years, because the economy has really been hard hit, the pool is getting smaller and smaller. We simply don’t have spare cash to put into speculative assets. Those that had some of these assets are being forced to sell them just to make ends meet.”De Sousa is still optimistic that many South Africans are well-informed about cryptocurrencies and that many see the value in trading and investing in cryptocurrency assets — Bitcoin in particular: “The South African crypto trading community is big but the Bitcoin community is much bigger and there are a lot of people that still consider it a very good asset and a store of wealth.”Going beyond the hypeThe issue of education is another major consideration when it comes to the proliferation of cryptocurrency trading. Mistrust and misconception yet prevails around cryptocurrencies and their perceived use as a means to facilitate illicit activities around the world. Binance South Africa country manager Tanya Knowles told Cointelegraph that education is an important factor in growing the use of cryptocurrencies in Africa.“The biggest thing right now with Binance coming into the country is to ensure there is education around scams that are associated with anything that we do. We have to have a lot of emphasis around security, make sure people are using 2FA and other safety measures. We need to get the basics in place before we open it up and say, go wild and start trading.”Knowles added that the simplest way for people to become acquainted with cryptocurrencies was to begin trading with small amounts, starting with crypto holders giving non-holders small amounts of crypto as an introduction: “If you give somebody R100 in crypto, they’ll learn a way to either use it or spend it and I think that practical experience is the best way to role it out.”Related: The Blockchain Africa Participants Optimistic About Continent Becoming Center of ProgressMichelle Nsanzumuco, Fintech4Good lead for Africa, told Cointelegraph that the cryptocurrency sector is growing in pockets around the continent.“You’re finding that there are niche pockets and areas of interest and some countries where people are actively using crypto. Places like Zimbabwe, Nigeria and South Africa where there is an active crypto community that is really starting to get engaged in crypto.”These small sectors of adoption are a positive sign, but Nsanzumuco also stressed that education on the subject needs to be improved to help the cause, as a lot of young people seem to be interested in the sector. She added:“Speaking to more senior organisations and groups, the perception isn’t always positive — there’s that branding of all the dodgy stuff with crypto. There’s still quite a lot of education that needs to come and with education we will get adoption. Without the education and the no-how, it will be very difficult to remove ourselves from the hype.”Nevertheless, the fact that Africans have adopted and driven the development and widespread use of mobile payment systems across the continent is a positive sign for the uptake of new technologies and platforms. Nsanzumuco also said:“If you look at mobile payments, sub-saharan Africa created it. It’s not something that is new to us and I think just based on that, the fact that Africans are familiar with mobile payments might make it a little bit easier to engage with platforms and emerging technologies.”"

That same month, it expanded its partnership with Mastercard to further support its U.S. offering.The neobank and smartphone app is already firmly established in Europe — with over 10 million users, according to an email shared with Cointelegraph on March 24.In addition to streamlined fiat currency account services, Revolut has enabled users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies since 2017 — with current support for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), XRP.Chad West, director of marketing and communications at Revolut, told Cointelegraph that the firm is not yet launching crypto support as it “decided to gradually roll-out additional services in the U.S. market, as opposed to launching everything at once.”The company plans to announce further information about its cryptocurrency service in the coming weeks.Previously, a Revolut spokesperson had told Cointelegraph that as of last month, there was not yet a definitive roadmap or timeline for gaining approval to provide crypto services from myriad state-level regulatory authorities.FDIC-insured account fundsNew U.S. customers of Revolut will have to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification to be approved, after which they can open an account accessible on a smartphone.Via a partnership with Metropolitan Commercial Bank, Revolut is also offering FDIC insurance up to $250,000 and the ability to receive salary payments up to two days in advance via direct deposit.As Cointelegraph has reported, Revolut had attained unicorn status back in spring 2018 by receiving a $1.7 billion valuation after a Series C investment round."

This model has reportedly helped dozens of initiatives secure funding from BitAngels members over the past seven years.In response to the public health crisis, virtual pitch events will now be run by HQ and individual chapters across cities — including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Brussels — starting from April 9. All network members will have access to recordings of each meeting.BitAngels’ foundersAs previously reported, both Michael Terpin and his BitAngels co-founder David Johnston have been in the industry since the early 2010s. The latter went on to found a DApps Fund in 2014 and, more recently, YCG, a venture studio that builds blockchain applications for enterprise.Alongside BitAngels, Terpin is the founder and CEO of Transform Group — a blockchain advisory and events firm that has reportedly worked with over 30% of CoinMarketCap’s 100 companies and foundations. He is also the founder of the business newswire Marketwire.In 2018, Terpin became known across the industry for bringing a high-profile lawsuit against telecom giant AT&T following his personal loss of $24 million in crypto due to a SIM-swap scam.In May 2019, Terpin won $75.8 million in a civil case against Nichola Truglia, who had defrauded him of his crypto assets."

Then, as now, the Fed removing barriers to dollar liquidity ultimately sent the precious metal shooting higher.As various sources reported, the Fed will now embark on a giant buyback exercise which will be worth $125 billion each day — or a massive $2.5 trillion per month.Aimed at shoring up the U.S. economy, the scheme is akin to flooding the market with “new” dollars in what has become the biggest money printing experiment in U.S. history.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has already described the liquidity on offer to businesses and banks as “almost unlimited.”In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, went further still, saying:“There is an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do to make sure there’s enough cash in the banking system.”Fed going “full Zimbabwe”This, in turn, has emboldened gold bugs and Bitcoiners alike, who argue that fiat is rapidly unraveling as a trustworthy financial instrument.

He argues that once the virus reaches the jail, “it will be nearly impossible to stop its spread,” adding that “the risk to Mr. Goettsche’s health and safety grows with each day that he remains incarcerated” at the facility.New Jersey jail under fire for widespread health and safety issuesAccording to Weeks’ representation, the county jas has “an exceptionally poor record of maintaining detainee health.”He cited the findings of the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General, who last year reported that the facility poses “significant threats to detainee health and safety.”The inspector general identified “leaks causing mold and mildew growth 'in every housing unit holding detainees,” and food safety issues including “'raw, spoiled, or expired' meat, 'raw chicken,' 'expired and moldy bread,' and 'hamburgers that were foul smelling and unrecognizable’.” Weeks’ lawyer argued:“Given the noted risks of illness through inadequate food service and environmental safety at the Essex County Correctional Facility, a swift outbreak of COVID-19 at the facility is virtually inevitable.”The lawyers also argued that a lock-down at the facility would make it impossible for the suspects to comply with discovery requests in their ongoing proceedings.BitClub Network accused of scamming $722 millionGoettsche, Weeks, and two other defendants are accused of operating a $722 million Ponzi scheme from 2014 until December 2019 under the guise of running the cryptocurrency mining pool BitClub Network.The group allegedly solicited funds from investors in exchange for purported shares in their mining pools, also offering referral bonuses to those who recruited new members. The prosecution accused BitClub of distributing false and misleading documentation to investors that claimed to demonstrate profits generated by the mining pool.Goettsche and Weeks are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while all four of the scheme’s operators face charges of conspiracy to sell unregistered securities."
41802, Major Crypto Player-Backed PAC to use Tokens to ‘Vote’ for Candidates ,2020-03-24t07:05:00+00:00,1942,102,"One of the hot button issues for elections in the United States is separating money and politics. At the center of this topic is political action committees (PACs), organizations that can support candidates or legislation with money raised privately.HODLpac, the PAC founded by Tyler Whirty of the venture capital firm the Takoma Group, may be looking at a new way for Americans to donate to congressional candidates using crypto. By doing so, they may not only demonstrate how blockchain can be utilized for campaign contributions, but also supporting crypto-friendly legislation by donating to candidates who do the same.There are quite a few big names in the crypto community behind the PAC. According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, HODLpac’s founding donors include the Winklevoss twins, Donald Wilson Jr. from DRW, Brian Armstrong and Emilie Choi from Coinbase, Olaf Carlson-Wee at Polychain, and Kristin Smith from the Blockchain Association.Using tokens to ‘vote’ for candidatesUnder HODLpac’s voting mechanism, Whirty has stated that each person would be able to use Ethereum-based tokens to receive a certain number of “HODLvotes” for every donation they make. However, at the moment the PAC will be testing the method not with crypto but by using We the Peeps, a fundraising platform created by Peeps Democracy.Once “voting” with tokens begins, donors will receive one HODLvote for every dollar donated. These HODLvotes can then be used to support candidates by buying “Donation Points”. Donation Points cost the square number of HODLvotes, meaning if a donor were to have sixteen votes, they could buy four points. The total number of points are then used to determine which candidates receive funds.According to Whirty, this decentralized approach allows all voters to express a degree of preference for multiple candidates, not just a direction for their funds. It also helps ensure that donors who contribute more money don’t have an unrepresentative say on where the funding goes.HODLpac has raised $21,000 to date according to the FEC, $4,600 of which has been spent on operating expenditures. The PAC went live on March 23 and doesn’t currently accept cryptocurrency donations, though Whirty said that may change in the future.Crypto donations in US electionsThe FEC has stipulated that politicians can receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as contributions if they are properly disclosed, though the overwhelming majority have not taken advantage of this. After Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and Andrew Yang withdrew their campaigns, there are no candidates remaining in the 2020 presidential election accepting crypto donations.However, Agatha Bacelar, a Stanford engineer and designer running against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, announced that she would be accepting BTC, Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and USD Coin (USDC) through Coinbase to raise funds."

These payments would last until the economy recovers.While the proposal does indicate the option of providing checks, it would require member banks of the federal reserve to maintain digital dollar wallets for all clients.The massive stimulus package and current gridlockThis version of the bill seems to come from the office of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

According to the regulator, fraudsters also request unnecessary fees for cashing out and tax payment.The statement by the CFTC reads:“After depositing a few hundred dollars of cryptocurrency, the traders are fed a number of fake statements showing huge returns. When the traders try to cash out, they’re told they must first pay a fee to get their earnings. They pay the fee, then are told they need to pay a tax, then more fees, and so forth. Never send more money to get what is yours.”James McDonald, CFTC enforcement director, told Cointelegraph that the commission will continue to cooperate with regulatory authorities to tackle illicit activity on the market. McDonald said:“The CFTC will vigorously pursue those who might consider using this turbulent time to mislead and defraud people.

41777," Using Ransomware, Hackers Steal and Publish Medical Data of Firm Researching Coronavirus ",2020-03-23t19:03:00+00:00,5343,110,"Black hat hacker group Maze has infected the infrastructure of a firm researching the coronavirus with ransomware, managing to steal and publish sensitive data.The hack of medical informationCybersecurity firm Emsisoft told Cointelegraph on March 23 that Maze group’s hackers compromised United Kingdom medical firm Hammersmith Medicines Research. The published data includes sensitive data on medical test volunteers such as id documents like passports, medical background and details of the tests. Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow said:“[The data] is on the clear web where it can be accessed by anybody with an internet connection. [...] The criminals almost certainly haven’t published all the data that was stolen. Their modus operandi is to first name the companies they’ve hit on their website and, if that doesn’t convince them to pay, to publish a small of the amount of their data — which is the stage this incident appears to be at — as so-called ‘proofs.’”Fortunately, ComputerWeekly reports that the Hammersmith Medicines Research was able to make the systems operational by the end of the day. Callow noted that “it would appear they were able to quickly restore their systems from backups.” He also said that the data previously published on the hacker’s website is no longer available:“Note that, since the ComputerWeekly report ran, the data stolen from HMR has been ‘temporarily removed’ from the criminals’ website. [...] But here’s the problem. Other criminals download the data posted on these leak sites and use it for their own purposes.”Callow told Cointelegraph that he does not know how high the ransom demanded was. Still, he pointed out that the group has previously asked for about $1 million in Bitcoin for restoring access to the data and another $1 million in BTC to delete their copy and stop publishing it.As Cointelegraph reported in early February, Maze also compromised five United States law firms and demanded two 100 Bitcoin ransoms in exchange for restoring data and deleting their copy. Callow said that ransomware groups nearly always request to be paid in Bitcoin:“99% of ransom demands are in Bitcoin and, to date, it has been the Maze group’s currency of choice.”Criminals are not Robin HoodIn previous incidents, Maze also published stolen data on Russian cybercrime forums recommending to “Use this information in any nefarious ways that you want.” Callow also criticized “a not inconsiderable number of publications” that recently reported about how some ransomware groups — including Maze — stopped their attacks for the time of the pandemic. He said:“A not inconsiderable number of publications recently reported that some ransomware groups, including Maze, had declared an amnesty on attacks on medical organizations for the duration of the Covid-10 outbreak and I’ve since seen them described as ‘Robin Hood-esque.’ This clearly demonstrates that, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, criminals cannot be trusted and it is a mistake for them to be given a voice.”Callow said that the threat level is the same that it has always been, or possibly higher.

The firm explained:“By implementing Matic’s high-performance Plasma-based sidechains, Somnium aims to solve any future issues around scalability and user experience such as high-throughput, fast confirmation times, and negligible transaction fees.”A growing VR economySomnium Space CEO Artur Sychov explained that the firm believes that Matic will allow the economy internal to its VR world to scale significantly and grow its community in the coming months. He explained to Cointelegraph the reasons the company decided to move to Matic:“Due to the fact that Loom has decided to shut down their customer facing solution we were forced to search for a new reliable partner for a second layer scalability. Matic was an obvious choice due to their team expertise and other well-known projects working with Matic already.”Sychov told Cointelegraph that his firm is “mightily impressed with the team's support on the business end” and that this is what makes Matic a better fit for the project compared to Loom. He explained that the tools provided by Matic allow his team to focus on the project’s development.Loom Network had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for more information as of press time. This article will be updated should their comments come in.The rise of MaticWhen asked about what makes the network a good fit for the project, a Matic representative said:“We don't want to toot our own horn. But the answer lies in the trust a lot of leading projects are placing in us, for example Decentraland, battle racers, springrole, sandbox and many more. We aim not only to provide state of the art tech but also keep the developer experience at the center of everything that we do.”As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Ethereum-based VR world The Sandbox recently announced a partnership with Matic, noting that the network will allow the DApp to carry out faster transactions and create a better user experience."
41774," MakerDAO's Storm Has Passed, but Community Still Faces Tough Decisions ",2020-03-23t18:34:00+00:00,1772,124,"The MakerDAO (MKR) auction to recover DAI collateral debt is almost complete, though the procedure suffered some technical setbacks. The community largely remains optimistic about Maker’s handling of the situation, as many took the opportunity to scrutinize and fix other potential issues.The auction started on March 19 at approximately 10:30 AM EST with a somewhat uneventful kick off. Some of the people who had tuned in expected it to finish quickly, but the specifics of the auction made it a very gradual process.One community member jokingly said, “I can't wait to tell my grandkids about this,” as only two bids appeared in the first 20 minutes of the sale.Wide community participationThe MKR auction was different from regular MakerDAO auctions in that the wider decentralized finance (DeFi) community also came out in support.A “backstop syndicate” was formed in the days before the kick off, seeking to act as a buyer of last resort if the auction price fell below 100 DAI.The syndicate included many Ethereum and DeFi community members, as well as venture funds. Framework Ventures’ Michael Anderson revealed to Cointelegraph that the fund joined the backstop — despite passing on Maker previously. The importance of DAI’s stability for DeFi as a whole was the main reason for the decision.The grassroots community also took part, which resulted in some new chat members lamenting the lack of a user-friendly UI for bidding. As Cointelegraph learned when preparing for the auction, Keepers require at least intermediate programming knowledge to be used successfully.Nevertheless, the Maker Foundation quickly revealed a bidding UI specifically for the MKR auction. Many welcomed the addition, with the team adding that regular auctions will eventually be joinable with the interface as well.Security anxietyJust before the auction kicked off, some people discussed the security of the MKR auction contract. Kurt Barry from Maker Foundation gave a partial reassurance:“We had a bunch of people review it and it's a pretty simple contract. Doesn't mean it's bullet proof, but given the little time we had, hopefully it's enough.”The auction mostly proceeded without issues and plenty of buyers showed interest. But a technical glitch blocked as many as 20 auction lots from going through — for $1 million worth of DAI.The Maker community will have to decide what to do with it shortly, as the lots need to be manually re-sent. The developers note that the debt would take about 90 days to be cleared during normal operations.Despite this sour note, the overall community remains optimistic. Brian McMichael, a smart contract developer for Maker, tweeted:“The Maker team has been working flat-out since Black Thursday. I was doing 16-18 hour days for over a week. We all love what we do and are committed to Maker's success. I think that we've weathered this storm and have come out stronger on the other side.”Tough choices to makeIn Black Thursday’s aftermath, the Maker governance forums lit up with ideas to safeguard the system even further. One of them is the proposal to shut down the old Single Collateral DAI (SCD) as its dwindling liquidity exposes the protocol to vulnerabilities.Originally, SCD was set up to decline in usage naturally — a process that is not occurring quickly enough, according to some. A shutdown is bound to catch some users unprepared, however.Before the auction, an emergency measure was passed to add USDC as another collateral form. This was believed to be necessary to stabilize DAI’s peg to the U.S. dollar in the short term. The idea is not without its opponents, with the co-founder of DeFi platform Uma Protocol, Allison Lu, citing technical flaws with the idea — in addition to the ideological issue of a centralized collateral asset.In the meantime, the victims of the zero-DAI liquidations are still not repaid as the auction merely recapitalized the system. MakerDAO governance is currently discussing how much, if at all, they should be directly compensated."

At the risk of sounding repetitive, traders have to continue to focus on the events that are driving the various asset classes. The Coronavirus cases in Europe are not showing signs of flattening out and the number of cases in the US are surging at a rapid pace. This raises the uncertainty on how long and how much damage will this pandemic do before it is contained. As a result, the equity markets continue to be hammered down.Due to strong measures like lockdowns, the economy will go through a slowdown. In order to support the economy, the United States Federal Reserve, central banks and governments continue to announce measures meant to boost investor sentiment.

Coley explained that as the markets have matured over the past year, institutional investors could be looking to take advantage of the current low prices to make an entry into this space.In today’s analysis, we have suggested several trades on the major cryptocurrencies. The traders can do their due diligence and stick to the ones which interest them. As the situation remains uncertain, volatile movements cannot be ruled out. Therefore, keep the position size only 40% of usual.Let’s study the charts of the major cryptocurrencies to determine the ones that look strong?BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA at $6,835 on March 20. However, since then, the price has been consolidating close to the overhead resistance at $6,435. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewConsolidation near the critical resistance increases the possibility of a breakout of it. Therefore, we anticipate the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If the BTC/USD pair can close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA, it is likely to rally to the 50-day SMA at $8,435.70.Therefore, we suggest traders buy on a close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA and keep a stop loss at $5,600.Contrary to our assumption, if the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, a drop to $5,660 is possible. Below this level, a drop to $5,000 is likely.ETH/USDEther (ETH) is currently trading between $117.090 and $155.612. A bounce off the support at $117.090 can carry the price to the resistance at $155.612. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this level, hence, we expect the bears to defend this level once again.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the price again turns down from $155.612, the ETH/USD pair will extend its stay inside the range. Nonetheless, if the bulls can push the price above $155.612, we anticipate a move to the 50-day SMA at $208.90.Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $155.612 and keep the stop loss at $117. If this level cracks, a drop to $100 is possible.XRP/USDXRP turned down from $0.17595 on March 20. However, the bulls are attempting to keep the price above $0.1450. If successful, we expect the bulls to make another attempt to break above $0.17468.XRP USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewOn a close (UTC time) above $0.17468, the XRP/USD pair can rally to $0.23532 and above it to $0.250. Therefore, the traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $0.17468 and keep a stop loss at $0.140.Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from $0.17468 once again, a drop to $0.145 is possible. A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been struggling to break above the 20-day EMA at $236. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. We expect the bulls to make another attempt to break above the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf successful, we expect a change in trend. Above the channel, a move to the 50-day SMA at $332 and above it to $400 is possible. Therefore, the bulls can purchase the breakout and close (UTC time) above the channel with a close stop loss at $196.Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the channel, the BCH/USD pair might again dip down to $190 and below it to $166.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) has been struggling to break above the 20-day EMA for the past three days. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This increases the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA at $171.5.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the BSV/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA, it can move up to the 50-day SMA at $242. Above this level, the up move can extend to $326.8.Therefore, we suggest traders buy on a close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA with a close stop loss at $146. A break below this level will be a huge negative as it can drag the price to $120 and below that to $100.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) turned down just below the 20-day EMA on March 20. However, the bulls purchased the dip to $34.6001 levels, which is a positive sign. The bulls will now once again attempt to push the price above the descending channel.LTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf successful, the LTC/USD pair can run-up to the 50-day SMA, which is likely to act as a resistance. If this resistance is crossed, the next level to watch is $80. Therefore, we retain the buy proposed in the previous analysis.Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the descending channel and plummets below $33, the advantage will turn in favor of the bears. Therefore, the stops can be placed at $33.EOS/USDEOS has roughly been trading between $2.1624-$2.4001 for the past three days. Though the bulls have not been able to break above this zone, we like that they have not given up much ground.EOS USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls can scale above the zone and the 20-day EMA, it will be a huge positive and will open the doors for a rally to the 50-day SMA at $3.6.

We are hopeful this can be easily resolved with a name change. Any continued usage by the Blockchain will only evidence an intentionally predatory, misleading and fraudulent strategy.”Earlier this month, Hive Blockchain announced it would expand its Ethereum (ETH) mining operations by 20%.Hive successfully forks off SteemOn March 18, a group of more than 30 former Steem developers announced their plan to execute a hard fork and break away from the network under the new branding of ‘Hive’. The move followed several weeks of well-documented conflict between the Steem community and the new owner of both Steemit Inc and 20% of STEEM’s supply, Justin Sun.On March 20, the Hive community successfully forked away from Steem — creating what is being called the Hive blockchain.The cryptocurrency is already being traded under the ticker ‘HIVE’ on at least four cryptocurrency exchanges including Bittrex — where it is trading at a 20% premium over STEEM."

As reported by local publication Sina Finance, the joint report was provided by blockchain professional information service platform Interchain Pulse and Beijing-based headhunting agency Liepin.Although blockchain job salaries in China significantly declined over the course of 2019, the report still outlines the increasing demand for blockchain professionals in various industries. However, the surging demand is accompanied by the increasing imbalance between supply and demand in the field of blockchain talent, the report notes.Professional skills of blockchain-focused job seekers are too weak, the report saysAs such, despite the rapid increase in job seekers, very few talents indeed meet the job requirements of recruiting companies, the study says. Additionally, the significant lack of high-end professional skills is reportedly becoming one of the biggest impediments for the development and adoption of the industry.The report continues:“In the supply-side market, a large number of practitioners blindly follow the trend, their professional skills are weak, and there is a serious shortage of practical compound talents.”China’s President headed for blockchain in late 2019Taking into account that China has been strengthening its blockchain engagement after its President called the country to accelerate blockchain adoption in late October 2019, the decrease in the average sum of blockchain job salaries is quite unexpected. However, the recent professional study still correlates with some reports issued earlier this year.As reported by Cointelegraph in January 2020, Chinese blockchain spending in areas of investment and financing deals tumbled more than 40% in 2019. The data was provided by China’s government-run financial information and media firm Xinhua and financial data platform Rhino Data.In mid-January, professional social network LinkedIn released a report projecting that blockchain will be the most demanded hard skill in 2020 alongside cloud computing, analytical reasoning and artificial intelligence."

41756, The Blockchain Africa Participants Optimistic About Continent Becoming Center of Progress ,2020-03-23t14:15:00+00:00,2004,134,"The Blockchain Africa conference produced a swathe of optimism for Africa to become a driving force behind the development and use of new blockchain-powered technologies.Over the past few years, blockchain has replaced cryptocurrency as the “it” word in the fintech space. It is a fact that was mirrored by the Blockchain Africa conference itself, with speakers focusing more on the possibilities of blockchain answering a number of industry inefficiencies, and far less on cryptocurrency trading and tokenized solutions.Africa has its own unique challenges in the global space given that many of its countries are trailing behind the rest of the world in infrastructure development. While the asymmetric digital subscriber lines and fiber internet connectivity is still being rolled out in many countries, mobile tower services have driven the proliferation of mobile payments systems.To say that Africans have taken to these services would be an understatement. The M-Pesa mobile payment service is a prime example that shows Africans can quickly adopt technologies that improve their day-to-day lives. Mobile network provider Vodafone estimates that over 37 million people across seven African countries currently use M-Pesa, which was launched in 2007.This is just one example of how people in Africa have benefitted from a future-forward solution to build a bridge to the people that are unbanked on the continent. In general, fintech solutions are being readily adopted and driven by African countries and companies. As Cointelegraph reported in an event recap of the Blockchain Africa conference, blockchain technology is already being explored by trade finance, supply chain and self-sovereign identity sectors. Here are the main use cases that can be observed right now:A solution for Africa’s ID problemsThe issue of Self-Sovereign Identity is a particularly interesting one in an African context, given the difficulty many people on the continent face when trying to obtain ID documentation. By way of definition, SSI refers to a situation where individuals hold and control their own identification credentials.Victor Mapunda, CEO and founder of startup FlexFinTx, made a compelling case for a move to digital-based identities at the Blockchain Africa conference. In his presentation, data quoted by Mapunda estimates that nearly 400 million Africans do not have proper identification credentials. This then leads to a multitude of difficulties, as these people are unable to open bank accounts, apply for insurance or other financial products.Related: Blockchain Digital ID — Putting People in Control of Their DataBeing banked and having insurance is a luxury when considering the deeper problems that are plaguing the continent. Referring to information supplied by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, only eight African countries have birth registration systems that cover 90% of the population.Countries like Chad and Tanzania are only able to cover 12% of births in the country. Conversely, Egypt, Mauritius and Seychelles are the only three African countries that register deaths covering more than 90% of their population.The key takeaway is that there is a sizable gap in providing Africans with vital identification documentation, which is primarily due to institutional inefficiencies. Data capturing and information sharing is therefore impacted, leaving various institutions lacking in information, unable to serve the public needs efficiently.Mapunda hails from Zimbabwe and began exploring the issue of SSI when he faced his own difficulties in trying to register a bank account after studying abroad. FlexFinTx seeks to provide people with a digital ID through WhatsApp, which facilitates the issuance of a FlexID that is cryptographically secured by the Algorand blockchain. Users then have self-sovereign control over how their data is shared. Speaking to Cointelegraph after his presentation, Mapunda said that African people can quickly take to solutions that solve wide-ranging problems:“I think Africans, when it comes to adoption of technology, are some of the most dynamic people in the world, this is because, for the most part, we don’t have a lot of legacy infrastructure and institutions. Most of the things we’ve grown up with didn't work.”Mapunda pointed to innovations such as mobile money and internet-based communication applications drastically improving Africans’ quality of life, saying, “Mobile money is a great example. We jumped on it,” and adding that no one even had to market it to the population. He went on to expand further:“WhatsApp is a very good example of an application that didn’t have a single billboard, yet it managed to spread like wildfire across Africa. It solved a major problem — the cost of communication was too expensive and it's a natural solution that people gravitate to.”An answer to supply chain challengesBlockchain technology has long been touted as a key tool in improving current supply chain systems across the world. In the past three years, major strides have been conducted in this regard, providing real use cases to back up the theory. The subject was covered extensively at the Blockchain Africa conference and was particularly important considering the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area in May last year.The move created a free-trade area that now includes 28 African countries, which requires member states to remove tariffs to provide the free trade of goods and services. While it improves the ease of trade, there are still some hurdles to clear in the trade finance and supply chain.Thavash Govender, a data and AI specialist at Microsoft South Africa, spoke to Cointelegraph during the summit and said that blockchain technology could hold a number of benefits for trade across the continent:“The one challenge that we have at the moment is trust between different countries. If I’m going to drop my trade barriers and say you can bring all your products into my country, I need to know that we aren’t allowing counterfeit goods in.”Perhaps more importantly, Govender suggested that systems that are improved through the use of blockchain technology could drastically reduce the amount of time it takes for trade to take place due to inefficiencies in various processes, elaborating:“If I’m an SME, I’m going to open up to a whole bunch of institutions that I just don't know. If we're all part of the same blockchain consortium, then I know I can trust what is written on the chain. Because I can trust the information, I can move a lot quicker. It’s not going to take me weeks of investigation, so I can grant loans quicker or get the trade finance process going a lot faster.”Public procurement and corruptionAnother interesting implementation of blockchain technology is in the space of public procurement by government organizations. Corruption is not a uniquely African problem, but it is one that affects many countries on the continent. Sope Williams-Elegbe, a professor and deputy director of the African Procurement Law Unit at Stellenbosch University, gave a presentation on the possibilities of blockchain addressing corruption in public procurement.Related: Zimbabwe U-Turns on Crypto, Looking to Stabilize Local EconomyWilliams-Elegbe said that 15%–22% of South Africa’s gross domestic product goes to public procurement. The problem is that the country loses 50% of this to corruption and fraud.The professor believes that blockchain could be used to address procurement corruption but admitted that there are few to no use cases as of now. There is a lack of technical applications for public procurement, and it presents an opportunity for new solutions.Forget the hype, build on working techMichelle Nsanzumuco, who acts as a senior advisor to the government of Bermuda and the Africa lead for Fintech4Good, spoke about a number of the sectors described above as being potential drivers of blockchain technology.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Nsanzumuco highlighted supply chain and logistics as the key industry that can leverage blockchain due to the complexities of trade created by the sheer number of players in a value chain. Nsanzumuco said that a number of entrepreneurs and SMEs that she has interacted with often complained about the difficulties they face when conducting trade inside their own country:“They’re finding barriers just within their own countries because they’re dealing with so many different players, fill in so much documentation before they can even get their products from A to B. Now we haven't even talked about cross-border transactions and trade. I can see it being a very strong use case for Africa specifically around supply chain and health care.”Nsanzumuco added that blockchain solutions could improve the way health care systems track vaccinations and medications. Another factor is improving government services by digitizing a variety of manual data-capturing processes. Additionally, while strongly agreeing that the continent could be a leader in the blockchain space, Nsanzumuco cautioned against touting “blockchain” tech because of its marketability:“A big warning for me having traveled around the world is not getting caught up in the hype. Let’s leverage real solutions in particular sectors where it can have an impact in Africa.”"
41755, Bidders Pay Up to 24% Less for MKR in Phase Two of MakerDAO Auction ,2020-03-23t14:09:00+00:00,1480,77,"As the first MakerDAO debt auction draws to a close, March 23, a total of $4.3 million worth of undercollateralized Dai (DAI) has been bid across both phases, and will be burned.But those bidders who waited for the second phase bagged the best deals, with some winners paying 24% less per Maker (MKR) token than the highest bidders in phase one.Bargains to be had in the second phase of the auctionOpening offers on each of the 86 total lots were to receive 250 Maker tokens for fixed bids of 50,000 Dai. Subsequent bids then reduced the amount of MKR received, with the minimum reduction of 3% of the existing bid.During the period of the first auction, MKR price went up from its initial level of around $265 to spike at over $300. This led to the automated auction-keeper bots placing bids for increasingly lower amounts of Maker.Thirty-three of the 40 lots released in phase one were won with bids of 188.68 MKR, representing an equivalent token price of $265.00. However, the seven lots won with the highest bids, sold at a token price of $289.57.In contrast, 50% of the 46 lots released in phase two were won with bids of $220.00 per Maker token, representing a 24% saving over the highest price paid in phase one.A further 12 lots were won with bids equivalent to $226.60 per token, and another seven with bids of $233.64. Two of the lots were won with early low bids of around $250 per token, and two lots are outstanding at the time of publishing.MKR price had dropped back to $265 by the start of phase two of the auction, and has since continued to fall to $245.More unique bidders in phase twoAs Cointelegraph reported, 33 of the 40 lots auctioned in phase one were won by just three bidders, leading to accusations that the Maker Foundation had taken part in the auction itself.The Maker Foundation refuted these claims, explaining that it had simply offered limited technical assistance to help some bidders participate in the auctions. It stressed that this assistance, “in no way provides informational or any other advantage to those bidders.”While the second phase of the auction has certainly seen some heavyweight bidders trying to win multiple lots, there have also been smaller bidders. According to stats logged by Dune Analytics, phase two has seen 30 unique bidders, as opposed to 25 in the first phase.Whoever wins the tokens, the debt auction mechanism has been shown to function as intended. It was designed to deal with shortfalls in collateral for total Dai issued through the Maker Protocol, and has managed to raise $4.3 million in the wake of the recent Ether (ETH) market crash.Even those who paid the most for their Maker tokens have still got a bargain in relation to the longer-term price. In the year-to-date prior to the crash which triggered the auction, MKR traded at an average price of around $550."

That means unlimited QE. Not only the crypto markets are showing a bounce, but other markets are also experiencing the same.Equity markets in the United States hit their limit down of 5% in the futures markets earlier today, but are up 8% since the low. What can be expected from the crypto markets, due to this news?Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360Bitcoin holds the $5,600 supportBTC USD 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe previous article was showing a bullish scenario, through which the price of Bitcoin (BTC) had to hold this $5,600-5,700 level for support. The confirmation came, and the price of Bitcoin rallied upwards, mainly because of the news from the Fed.However, is the view on the price change? No. The price of Bitcoin is still resting beneath the crucial level of $6,800-6,900. A breakthrough in this resistance would benefit further upwards momentum. Until then, the market likely shows a bearish retest and some relief. Such is due to relief on all the equity markets.Are equity markets continuing their relief bounce?German stock index DAX 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewIt’s likely to see a relief bounce on the equity markets for several reasons. One of the reasons is the economic measures taken by governments to help companies and people in their financial problems.The other one is the acceptance and understanding of the effects of the coronavirus. The first wave of panic is now over, so these effects are already priced in. Alongside that, the indicators are showing a massive drop in the equity markets, which generally gives space for some upwards bounces.As discussed in an earlier article, the first drop of a market reversal ends up being between 35-50%.

They dropped down simultaneously, so they’ll bounce up simultaneously as well until the correlation drops. Recently, every market is still showing positive correlations with each other.Not only the equity markets and Bitcoin have been showing strong bounces in the past hours, but a similar bounce is also shown on the commodities (gold and silver) markets.Total market capitalization crypto still beneath resistanceTotal market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is still showing a clear view of the markets. If the total market capitalization remains below $185-188 billion, lower levels should be tested for support. The moment the market flips the red zone for support, then there’s more bullish and upwards momentum likely to occur towards $240 billion.However, the markets have rejected massively previously at the $6,800 barrier, which might indicate that there’s not much bullish momentum going on right now, especially after a 50% drop in one day.The bullish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD bullish scenario 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario is remaining reasonably unchanged. A clear break of the red zone at $6,800-6,900 is needed in order to sustain and warrant bullish momentum.However, short-term support levels can be tested before this test occurs. Through that, the market wants to see continued higher lows in order to keep an uptrend going.A flip of the $6,100 level is the first step, after which the $6,500 level needs to be flipped for support. If these levels flip, a test of the $6,800-6,900 resistance area is the next step. If that level breaks, the market is likely to see a $1,000 candle towards $7,800, as that’s the next resistance to be watched.Such a move would flip the momentum bullish in general. However, as stated previously, the $6,800-6,900 area is crucial to be flipped as support. When that happens, more upside is on the tables.The bearish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD bearish scenario 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario is still the primary scenario. As long as $6,800-6,900 is not broken to the upside, there’s more downside to be expected.The most likely scenario is a rising wedge structure, through which the liquidity at the upside is taken at $6,800-6,900 before the price drops to the support levels at $4,800 and $5,200.A lower high at $6,500-6,600 is also beneficial for such a downwards drop.All-in-all, the market should consider the action taken by the Fed to be positive in the short-term, though these measures may trigger further dropdowns in the next months, which may negatively impact Bitcoin’s price as well.But, long-term, more dollars being created is bullish for Bitcoin and commodities.

41752, Telos Foundation Removes Board Member After Security and Centralization Disputes ,2020-03-23t13:44:00+00:00,1181,67,"The Telos Foundation — the organization behind smart contract platform Telos (TLOS) — has taken action against two of its board members following a network security controversy.Telos is a platform that supports the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) running on EOS.io, the software underlying the EOS blockchain.In a blog post published on March 22, the foundation announced that it had made “appropriate adjustments to its board and various board member responsibilities” in light of recent controversial developments, as it “holds network security in the highest regards.”The two board members in question are Daniel Uzcátegui, who has been removed from the foundation’s board as of March 11th, and Richard Bryan, who will remain on the board but will no longer engage in block production or node operation on Telos.Background to the foundation’s actionsLike EOS, Telos uses a consensus mechanism known as “delegated proof-of-stake,” in which network participants are able to stake their tokens to vote for so-called Block Producers (BPs) as their elected delegates.In this system, BPs in part serve a similar function to miners on the Proof-of-Work-based Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain or staking nodes on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol.They also have additional responsibilities to miners, as the top 21 BPs elected on the network are granted full executive power and so wield a decisive vote on all decisions regarding the blockchain.In its blog post, the foundation writes that it discovered earlier this month that several BPs had been implicated in disputes that related to “inappropriate shared access” to their signing keys, thereby degrading network security.The controversy over the safety of apparently inappropriate key sharing was addressed in a personal statement published by Richard Bryan on March 10. Bryan is a Telos Foundation board member who until now ran the “TelosDAC” BP, on which Daniel Uzcátegui also served as a technical advisor. Bryan wrote:“In order for Daniel to be effective in some of his work [...] with us he needed to have a safe level of access to our infrastructure. This was well planned and arranged using SSH provisioning tools [...] and keys obscured using available tools. At no time did Daniel have access to our BP owner key [...]”Bryan has now pledged that he will no longer engage in block production/node operation on Telos nor on any of the public EOSIO blockchains currently in operation.This, he says, is due to the fact that he lacks an “in-depth understanding of the implications of shared active keys,” as well as not having the knowledge that would be required to detect unusual activity on nodes.Structural reformThe foundation’s announcement clarifies that according to its bylaws, outgoing board members will remain in the organization for 30 days after their removal in order to transition their responsibilities to remaining members.Beyond adjusting its board, the foundation has responded to the controversy by planning to put a Telos Foundation Transparency Amendment up for vote. This will attempt to address security concerns, clarify the organization’s structure, and separate board members from operational members in order to prevent excessive centralization.EOS’ own controversiesEOS has itself faced criticisms over similar issues to those currently being debated at Telos. In fall 2019, an EOS BP raised concern over apparent levels of centralization and misconduct, claiming that six registered producers on EOS were being managed by a single entity."
41751, What On-Chain Analytics Tell Us About Bitcoin Transactions in 2020 ,2020-03-23t13:28:00+00:00,2443,93,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been the most interesting asset over the last decade and on-chain analytics can prove such a statement. Since its inception, and until the first quarter of 2020, Bitcoin has increased over 1,000,000% in value, climbing from $0.05 to around $10,000. However, it is also true that Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter, has ever faced a great recession or depression during its brief history. At least, it has not faced one in its entirety, since Bitcoin was born in 2009 in the middle of the financial crisis.Today, we aim to explore some key metrics that translate into adoption. Our goal is not to focus on technical analysis per se, but to look into on-chain metrics and see how they can impact the current and future price of BTC.Related: The Biggest Rises and Falls of Bitcoin, ExplainedI hope you’re as excited to find out what drives Bitcoin prices as I am eager to tell you. Ready to dive deep into Bitcoin’s future during the new roaring 2020s?This article was written by Pedro Febrero, with primary co-editing done by Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO at Quantum Economics, and Charles Bovaird, senior contributor for Forbes and vice president of content at Quantum Economics.Doing on-chain analytics like a proFirst off, let me define what we mean by “on-chain analytics.” Instead of focusing on price and traditional technical analysis techniques, we’ll look into all data that is natively stored on the blockchain.This data includes (but is not limited to):Details of every block (timestamp, fees, miner rewards, block weight, addresses, users, etc.)Details of every transaction (sending and receiving addresses, the amount transferred in each transaction, the remaining addresses, block time, etc.)Smart contract invocation and usage (mostly for Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens).In other words, the on-chain transaction volume is being used to judge whether a crypto asset is actually being used, and when and how that impacts its price and value.Instead of just crudely measuring the overall usage of a cryptocurrency network, I think we may use on-chain transaction data to figure out who is using Bitcoin, how they are using the network, and when certain metrics point to either bullish or bearish seasons.In sum, our objective is to translate key blockchain metrics into price appreciation metrics so that we can use them to predict important price movements.What metrics are we looking into?A great starting point is all the variables directly linked to the blockchain. Initially, we are looking into the four most basic, yet crucial, on-chain metrics available:Addresses — as in the amount each address holds, the length of time the amount has been held, and individual behavior.Transactions, as in the number, amounts transferred and total volume.Unspent transaction output (UTXO), as in the percentage of holders in profit, the total value created and the total value spent.Blocks — as in block height and block weight, or the actual size in bytes of both the total blockchain and a single block.There are plenty of other metrics we’ll put together in the future, as we would like to perform a comprehensive analysis of three distinct groups: transaction data, exchange and market data, and mining and fees data.Bitcoin transaction dataThe very first on-chain data points we’ll be analyzing relate to transaction data. Our core focus will be transaction count and volume, and how these metrics relate to Bitcoin price appreciation.Looking at the chart above showcasing the number of transactions per day from 2010 to February 2020, we can quickly see the trend is quite positive. Some important takeaways are:Transactions peaked at close to 490,000 per day in December 2017.Transaction count reached a low of approximately 132,000 transactions per day at the beginning of August 2017, and then peaked at around 500,000 transactions in mid-December 2017.Daily transaction value at the end of February 2020 was well over $3 billion.Daily transaction value increased over 200% from a low of $1 billion during April 2018, while price only increased around 2% in the same period.What becomes very clear from the data is that the correlation between price and transaction value seems to be deteriorating. While in the past, daily transaction value was increasing more or less according to price, the correlation seems to be less relevant today. Hence, the delta between price growth and daily transaction value growth seems to be increasing.To prove our point, let’s take a look at the total Bitcoin transfer volume.What we notice is the following: As price increases, total volume increases as well. However, since less Bitcoin is needed to achieve the same dollar equivalence, we could expect either fewer transactions with increased value or additional transactions with less value.During bullish periods, value increases exponentially, while total value diminishes significantly in bearish periods, as expected.Hence, in terms of transaction data, what we conclude is that while the total number of Bitcoin transactions has been steadily increasing, volume seems to be much more volatile, meaning the current price of Bitcoin is a speculative one.Bitcoin address dataBitcoin addresses show the behavior of BTC holders. The main data we’ll be looking into is the number of active addresses and how much each one holds. Such metrics may help us understand how people behave during bullish and bearish seasons.The first chart we need to look at is the number of active addresses. It not only shows an increasing interest by people in general, but the drop between late 2017 high to the present isn’t too significant. Essentially, the number of active addresses fell about 25%, while Bitcoin price dropped a whopping 66% in the same period.This suggests that long-term users of the cryptocurrency care little about price swings.Additionally, let’s compare the above to the number of total addresses. How do you think it has been growing in terms of non-zero balance addresses?If you answered “exponentially,” you would be correct.If this trend line reminds you of the Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, infection rate, that’s because it’s quite similar. Every year, the total number of addresses is almost doubling.Even though this metric cannot be linked to the number of active users, it clearly shows how much the network is being used.Otherwise, the number of addresses created shouldn’t be as great. Further, let me finalize the addresses section by looking at two additional metrics: the number of addresses holding over one BTC and the number of addresses holding over 1,000 BTC.The above chart shows the number of addresses holding over one BTC. It seems the growth rate increases by a factor of one every year. Interestingly, since the December 2017 price peak, the number of addresses holding over one Bitcoin has increased by close to 10%, from 718,000 to 787,000.This simply means more people want to hold a single Bitcoin.What about the number of institutional investors? Do you think they have been interested in buying or selling Bitcoin? Let’s take a look.The chart above showcases the number of addresses holding over 1,000 Bitcoin. We can clearly see that even though there was a sell-off during 2017 and 2018, institutions have still been buying afterward. Heavily.Since early 2019, the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC has increased by over 50%. Essentially, it went from under 1,750 addresses to a high of nearly 2,250 addresses.There are not likely many people with the capability to have purchased such an incredible amount of Bitcoin since 2019. Hence, probabilistically, such addresses are likely associated with institutions.Do you personally think whales represent smart or dumb money, generally speaking? If you answered “smart money,” then you already have a strategy laid out: Follow it.To conclude this section, I’ve shown how total addresses are not only growing in number, but also in value: The number of holders with over one Bitcoin is almost doubling every year, and the amount of institutions holding over 1,000 Bitcoin has increased by over 50% since 2019.Bitcoin UTXO dataData for unspent transaction output, or UTXO, is one of the most interesting sources of information to look into, at least in our opinion. For starters, it helps us understand the long-term behavior of Bitcoin holders, which comes in handy as our goal is to predict when to buy and when to sell.UTXO shows the addresses that have received BTC and not spend it afterwards.Let’s start with the Hodl Waves chart.For reading the graph above, allow me to use Unchained Capital’s own definition:“The colored bands show the relative fraction of Bitcoin in existence that was last transacted within the time window indicated in the legend. The bottom, warmer colors (reds, oranges) represent Bitcoin transacting very recently while the top, cooler colors (greens, blues) represent Bitcoin that hasn’t transacted in a long time.”The chart’s main points of interest seem to be the following:The number of enthusiasts holding for between three and five years, or for five years or more, has been showing the fastest growth rate. At the time of writing, the two groups combined represent more than 20% of all Bitcoin addresses. It’s incredible that so many folks have been holding for such a long period of time, considering the short life of the token.Price appreciation peaks are always followed by major sell-offs. The number of addresses holding Bitcoin for less than one year during these periods substantially increased. At the time of writing, about 40% of all addresses have traded Bitcoin in the past 12 months.Hence, what we can expect is that smart money will accumulate during bear markets and sell during bullish seasons. Much like what I concluded in the previous point when looking into the number of addresses holding over 1,000 BTC.Bitcoin block dataBefore we conclude this piece, we would like to take one last dive into the Bitcoin blockchain data. This time, we’ll look at blocks.We believe the starting point should be block weight. How much data does each block hold, on average? To answer such a question, we’ll turn to our pals over at Bitinfocharts, one of the best repositories for blockchain charts.At 1.2 megabytes, Bitcoin’s block weight, or the number of bytes of each block in the Bitcoin blockchain, is currently reaching its maximum.Block size peaked during late 2017 and early 2018, before many exchanges and other key players adopted Segregated Witness, or SegWit, shown below. The data shows an increasing adoption of SegWit, which removes the signature data from the block header, freeing up space for additional transactions.The really interesting thing we noticed from observing this data is that it seems to correlate with the graph above.Starting in October 2017, SegWit started getting adopted. Today, over 50% of all players use SegWit addresses. At the same time, block size started dropping in late 2017.Hence, it seems Bitcoin is further developing key improvements to its working mechanics, allowing for more transactions per block. Such improvements may accommodate more users, which may help with furthering adoption.Lastly, let’s take a look at the block height, which adds the previous blocks.What this data shows is that not only has the Bitcoin blockchain been working nonstop for the past ten years, but over 600,000 blocks have been created.In addition, the last time price touched the block height line, a massive bull run took place, taking BTC from less than $0.01 to nearly $8,000.If history rhymes, we could potentially see Bitcoin making way for brand new highs during late 2021, early 2024 and late 2027.ConclusionLooking at some key metrics relating to Bitcoin transactions, addresses, UTXO and blocks, we conclude that we’re in for an exciting couple of years.Arguably, the latest price drop that took Bitcoin below $5,000 on CoinMarketCap provided our last opportunity to purchase BTC below $10,000. Especially since the halving is almost coming. Hence, let me summarize this article’s findings:Transactions are not only increasing, but the amounts being transferred are as well. The impact on price appreciation has been quite positive during the past 10 years.The number of total addresses is growing as well as the amounts held by both dumb and smart money. Hence, there has been a positive impact on price.A great deal of Bitcoin is locked away by holders who only sell near peaks, meaning there’s little room for further falls until a new high is reached.Blocks are getting full and new techniques are allowing for more transactions to be added per block.Safe trades!The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

41750, All-in-One Trading Platform Combines Crucial Tools for First Time ,2020-03-23t12:55:00+00:00,4147,15,"A company says it provides the first complete crypto marketplace under Swiss law — bringing together services that were only available separately until now.According to UpBots, its mission is to become a preferred platform for beginner and professional traders alike. The service aspires to deliver a low learning curve for those who are new to cryptocurrencies or to trading in general, with risk-management tools designed to keep capital safe and reduce the risk of falling victim to scams.A comprehensive training section enables users to learn and grow at their own pace — with in-depth resources that are beneficial to more seasoned enthusiasts. UpBots also says it delivers a blockchain-based web and mobile trading platform that’s linked to major exchanges. Users have the freedom to rely on a complete set of sophisticated tools and strategies, and for those who prefer to develop their own algorithms, a bot creator section enables new algorithms to be created at will.Successful bots can also be rented out to others, and a social copy trading tool offers a much-needed bridge between established traders and newcomers.Enhancing the crypto trading experienceTheUpBots emphasizes it is attempting to tackle one of the biggest hurdles to mainstream adoption that exists today. According to the company’s white paper, many trading platforms have been welcoming increasing numbers of inexperienced traders who often have no knowledge of the market. Time starved and unwilling or unable to constantlyanalyze charts, “they enter into trades without a strategy, embrace inadequate risk management tools, and often maintain an inferior risk-to-reward ratio,” notes Benjamin Duval, one of the founders of UpBots. To add insult to injury, the team says that many established exchanges are failing to offer safeguards such as portfolio monitoring that can help prevent early experiences in crypto trading from being bad ones.More insights from UpBots hereAlthough UpBots is going to be focusing on thecrypto markets initially, the platform says it has bold ambitions to offer the same levels of accessibility across forex and commodities — enabling consumers who are interested in these asset classes to get involved in a meaningful way without requiring years of training and experience.Right now, UpBots claims that the typical newbie often lacks proper guidance and training resources, and usually quits the market after three to six months because they end losing a significant percentage of their capital. The company is hoping to upend the status quo by giving them “all of the tools that they need to succeed” — a one-stop-shop with an average monthly fee that’s lower than the cost of subscribing to specialist interfaces individually.Based on blockchainUpBots says that a major point of difference between its platform and those offered by competitors lies in how it is based on blockchain. According to the company, fully utilizing this technology helps to deliver security, trust and transparency. The team behind the platform is described as a group of experts and successful entrepreneurs who have experience in building an ecosystem, a dedication toward quality and excellence, and an insight into how current offerings in the marketplace are failing traders.To ensure the platform runs seamlessly, UpBots has created a new token called UBXt.

41747, P2P Exchange Paxful Teams Up With Chainalysis for Increased Overwatch ,2020-03-23t13:00:00+00:00,1892,86,"Peer-to-peer exchange Paxful will add security to its operation through a partnership with blockchain analysis outfit Chainalysis.Through a new partnership, Paxful will harness specific technologies from Chainalysis. “Paxful uses the Chainalysis Reactor to conduct deep investigations and the Chainalysis KYT to monitor transactions for any illicit behavior,” Youssef said, referring to the firm’s Know Your Transaction solution — a similar acronym to Know Your Customer, or KYC, regulations. Youssef added:“Through working with Paxful, Chainalysis is evolving its policy and will evaluate P2P exchanges on a case-by-case basis before labeling them as risky, just as it does for other cryptocurrency exchanges.”Prior to working with Paxful, Chainalysis viewed P2P organizations as having questionable safety, due to their lack of required user data, a press statement said.“Paxful is setting a new standard for compliance at P2P exchanges,” Paxful CEO Ray Youssef told Cointelegraph. “Chainalysis is changing its policy based on the strides P2P exchanges like Paxful have made.”Don’t users go to P2P exchanges seeking anonymity?At its core, crypto’s pioneer asset Bitcoin came into the world as an anonymous digital asset. Over the past 11 or so years since the industry’s beginning, a movement has pushed forward, touting the importance of data privacy.Historically, many crypto users have gravitated toward P2P outfits, such as LocalBitcoins, as a way of trading value while controlling their own privacy and data. Such a partnership between Paxful and Chainalysis could thus seem antithetical to the crypto industry’s founding ethos of privacy and anonymity.“The Paxful marketplace is for the honest users,” Youssef said in response to questions on the matter, adding:“Like in other industries, there are bad actors who try to scam and steal money anonymously from the honest users. They are the ones who fail to provide appropriate verification and are left with only one option: to flee. KYC and KYT keep the honest users in the platform, and give them more confidence to trade.”Anonymity and privacy are part of a double-edged sword. Authorities express the desire to protect users from fraudulent players, while some honest traders also prefer to guard their personal data. The topic remains up for debate."

By contrast, equity funding raised $2.8 billion last year.The report also notes the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), noting that there are currently more than $1 billion in assets on DeFi platforms — up from $300 million as of January 2019.Crypto firms are a major source of DLT funding2019 saw 807 venture deals signed, only a slight drop from 2018’s 822.

41739, Bitcoin Faces Critical Week to Confirm Safe Haven Potential — Analyst ,2020-03-23t10:50:00+00:00,3091,100,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have begun a “decoupling” from traditional markets to focus on price gains, but this week will be crucial, says Willy Woo.In a series of tweets on March 23, the respected statistician said that recent price gains for BTC/USD in the face of continued turmoil for stocks and the wider economy were encouraging.Woo: Bitcoin “seeking decoupling” from markets“Decoupling of safe havens from equities showing hints it may have begun (i.e. when BTC and Gold go bullish),” part of one post reads.“We'll have more confirmation in a week.”At press time, Bitcoin traded at around $5,800, having climbed almost 30% over the past week.A failure by the United States to agree on coronavirus stimulus measures meanwhile placed new selling pressure on stock markets across the world.

Source: Skew.comBTC could get its 2008 momentFor Woo, meanwhile, tentative signs that Bitcoin was recovering from investors selling to cover losses elsewhere suggested that it would reenact gold’s growth after the 2008 financial crisis.Such behavior would follow what he describes as “flight to safety 101.” He continued:“1) Traders exit risk-on leveraged positions and sit in USD. Retail investors sell to USD for runway (hard times ahead). All assets crash against USD.2) After peak fear, best assets for hedging the times ahead rise in value (Gold 2008, Gold & BTC 2020).”As Cointelegraph reported, further pain may yet be in store for Bitcoin investors before a full recovery gets underway.

41736, 'This Will and Needs to Be Bitcoin’s Year' Says Mike Novogratz ,2020-03-23t09:34:00+00:00,10843,239,"With vast swaths of the world markets in virtual lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, some predict that the shocks rippling through the global economy in early 2020 may yet come to dwarf the magnitude of the 2008 financial crash.Just as Bitcoin (BTC)’s creation is bound up with 2008 and the Great Recession, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz sees this year as make-or-break for the cryptocurrency.In a tweet posted on March 22 — just hours after the United States Congress failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on a proposed $2 trillion economic support package — Novogratz wrote:“$BTC will continue to be volatile over the next few months but the macro backdrop is WHY it was created. This will be and needs to be BTC’s year.”Never let a good crisis go to wasteEarlier this month, traditional markets had suffered their worst blows since 1987 — a plummet mirrored in Bitcoin’s 60% drop to lows of around $3,600 on some exchanges.As the pandemic enters its fifth week — exacerbated by collapsing demand and a price-war in the oil sector — spooked investors have continued their sell-offs overnight.Asian stocks have slumped in the fallout from the stalemate in Congress, with Wall Street futures crashing to hit their downside limit of 5%.Ten days ago — with investors deserting even “safe-haven” commodities such as gold — Novogratz argued that Bitcoin was no less vulnerable to the impact of the frantic liquidations:“[Bitcoin] was always a confidence game. All crypto is. And it appears global confidence in just about anything has evaporated.”Yet his latest tweet now points to the potential opportunities for the cryptocurrency amid the economic crisis.In this view, Bitcoin — as a censorship-resistant medium of exchange and non-inflationary unit of account — was designed precisely as an alternative to the faltering world monetary system.In a tweet that followed his remarks on Bitcoin yesterday, Novogratz had appealed to a stalling Congress not to repeat the “first failure of TARP” — the controversial bailout fund passed in 2008, which some consider to have left the structural weaknesses of the system virtually intact.Taking note of Bitcoin’s apparent decoupling from COVID-stricken traditional markets earlier this week, Changpeng Zhao — the CEO of crypto exchange Binance — had similarly argued that the pandemic should be understood as a trigger, rather than the root cause, of a visibly fragile world economic order."
41734, Is Staking the Answer to Cryptocurrency’s Mining Problems? ,2020-03-23t08:37:00+00:00,3503,309,"For a tech that was supposed to be democratic and distributed in order to free financial systems from the grip of government-influenced banks and return control of the money supply to the people, cryptocurrencies have turned out to be pretty concentrated.Some 66% of all Bitcoin (BTC) mining now takes place in China, with 54% located in the southwest province of Sichuan, as a recent study revealed. Three Chinese mining pools alone are responsible for nearly half of Bitcoin’s hashrate. The days when a single Bitcoin enthusiast could crunch numbers on their home computer and land a Bitcoin reward for helping to group transactions into blocks are long over.Related: The Dangers of Mining Pools: Centralization and Security IssuesThat is a problem, and not just because it centralizes a vital part of the Bitcoin infrastructure in a single location under the control of an authoritarian government. It’s also a problem because the reason Sichuan is such an attractive site is because it has cheap hydroelectric power. Mining might be a useful way to control the release of new coins, but it’s a huge waste of electric power at a time when the world is trying to become more energy efficient.Related: China’s Digital Yuan Is an Economic Cyberweapon, and the US Is DisarmingSo the cryptocurrency world is looking for solutions. It’s experimenting with new ways of building blocks and new ways to reward people who commit resources that maintain the cryptocurrency infrastructure.One solution has come in the form of staking. Mining rewards people who are willing to commit computational power to the blockchain. The more computing resources a mining pool commits, the greater the chances that it will be able to provide the proof-of-work — the solution to a mathematical puzzle — that lets them add blocks to the blockchain and claim their reward.Staking rewards people who are willing to commit cryptocurrencies, rather than computer power, to the blockchain. In return for agreeing to lock up a certain amount of digital coins, users can create masternodes that manage transactions. The more coins they commit, the greater the chances that they’ll receive a transaction fee. There’s no mining, and because there’s no difficult proof-of-work puzzles, there’s also much less demand on electricity.Dash, a Bitcoin fork, was one of the first cryptocurrencies to use masternodes. They function in the same way as Bitcoin’s nodes but require 1000 Dash as collateral in return for 45% of the block reward. Because the number of masternodes on the network varies, the returns on the collateral can vary too. Currently, the annual return is 6.55%, so the roughly $46,000 required to create a Dash masternode should return about $3,000 a year.PIVX is less demanding and offers its users two ways to earn from their activity in the community. A masternode requires 10,000 PIV, which is currently around $2,055. Alternatively, users can simply keep any amount of PIV in an active wallet, where that PIV will act as a stake. PIVX states that each masternode should receive a reward about once every one or two days, while a little more than 1,000 PIV in an active wallet should bring a reward every 30 days. PIXV masternodes currently return about $218 per year.Divi Project uses a particularly complex proof-of-stake structure. Its multi-tier masternode system gives different rewards based on the level of stake. Users willing to stake a million coins increase their chances of receiving a reward by ten times compared with those only staking 100,000 coins. There are also bonuses at each level. “We believe this system will encourage people to hoard or purchase more DIVI to reach the next level, helping to create a healthy node system,” wrote the company’s CEO Geoff McCabe onMedium.Even some of the largest organizations are now looking at proof-of-stake. Binance now has a staking feature offering a list of coins that users can own and hold, earning income as they hold. You can think of it as earning interest on a deposit account. TheEthereum upgrade is expected to move Ether (ETH) away from a proof-of-work requirement and toward aproof-of-stake requirement sometime in 2020.Related: Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum 2.0 Roadmap to CointelegraphIn this new cryptocurrency wave, anyone can earn once again by contributing to the system and without joining a hydro-powered mining pool in Sichuan.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Joel Comm is an internet pioneer, a New York Times best-selling author, futurist speaker and co-host of The Bad Crypto Podcast.

The exchange then went offline for around half an hour, after which the price recovered.After fending off claims of foul play, BitMEX still faced queries over why its giant insurance fund — a bank of over 35,000 BTC ($205.6 million) — was not used to help.Explaining its role, the blog post states that the fund’s primary purpose has always remained the same: to prevent auto-deleveraging (ADL) of successful traders’ positions to prevent the bankruptcy of positions that get liquidated.“It is important for the Fund to be large enough to absorb intraday shocks, to avoid ADL on the platform,” it summarizes.Fund’s size raises questionsNot everyone was convinced. Responding to the post, Twitter-based trader lowstrife argued that questions remained about BitMEX’s modus operandi.“The main question I raise here is why the insurance fund, when the worst-case scenario almost happened, was barely used,” he commented.“Which raises questions of why it's so large, and it's overall efficacy.

At the time of writing Bitcoin trades slightly below $6,000 and many traders anticipate further downside as the Coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the United States and Europe.Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360As mentioned by previous analysis last week, crypto traders, along with those in the traditional markets are keeping a close on how markets and investors respond to the assorted stimulus packages being prepared by governments around the world.If investors feel the financial aid packages are sufficient enough to meet the needs of citizens and corporations then they are likely to begin bargain shopping for stocks that are slated to recover quickly once the COVID-19 pandemic peters out.Large-cap cryptocurrencies are likely to also benefit if markets begin to recover but if investors observe equities markets continuing to fall even in the face of multi-trillion-dollar bailouts, they are unlikely to embrace stocks or cryptocurrencies, thus prompting further downside price action from Bitcoin.Let's take a quick look at the charts to see what is happening with Bitcoin’s price.Bulls fight to hold a key support zoneBTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewAs shown by the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin’s price dropped below the ascending trendline and 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level on Sunday. Currently, the support zone from $5,900 to $5,800 is holding but if the price falls below this point Bitcoin could revisit the $5,400 support.Below $5,400 draws up memories of the March 12 drop to $3,775 so bullish investors are likely crossing their fingers with hope that the $5,400 support holds.BTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewOn the daily timeframe, one can see that below $5,400 there is a high volume node on the VPVR at $4,061 and currently the lower Bollinger Band arm is at $4,660, somewhat close to where the price bounced on March 12 and March 16.At the moment the price is riding along the 20-MA of the Bollinger Band indicator and the MACD histogram is positive with a newly formed bull cross between the MACD and the signal line. Above $6,000, there is resistance at $6,400 and if this level could be flipped from resistance to support, a gap in the VPVR shows that the price could move to $6,900 and $7,166 with sustained volume.Short term strategyFor the time being, interim traders following the 4-hour chart can watch to see if Bitcoin price breaks above the ascending channel trendline to set a 4-hour close above $6,170. Risk-averse traders might consider waiting for a 4-hour to daily close above the $6,400 resistance.Since the Coronavirus outbreak, Bitcoin price has closely followed the decline in traditional markets and at the time of writing the S&P 500 and Dow futures are down 3.85% and 4% respectively. This drop came shortly after US lawmakers failed to agree on the specific details of a proposed $2 trillion Coronavirus economic stimulus package.This suggests that the markets will see similar losses when the opening bell rings in a few hours and one could infer that losses in traditional markets will not bode well for Bitcoin’s price action.Bearish traders looking to short might consider a drop below $5,800 as a lucrative opportunity to go short as $5,400 is 6.77% away and a drop to $4,700 and $4,061 is even more rewarding.Bitcoin daily price chart.

The data index shows searches for BTC increased by 183% over the past thirty days, while the number of those looking for information on the cryptocurrency on mobile devices also shot up.The interest may be related to the theory that a global economic meltdown may lead to a growing value for the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the banks.Searches for Bitcoin also up on GoogleWith Google currently blocked in China, Baidu is one of the most popular search engines. However, Chinese netizens aren’t the only ones with a growing interest in the crypto market.Google search results for BTC in the United States had a 30-day high on March 13. This was shortly after the cryptocurrency experienced its biggest daily drop in the last seven years when over $1 billion worth of longs was liquidated.What online searches for Bitcoin indicateWith a large portion of the world population now more plugged in than ever, it’s not surprising many have taken an interest in Bitcoin. However, the number of search results regarding buying the cryptocurrency are markedly higher than those seeking to sell it.This data is somewhat unusual as many Americans in larger cities are being advised to shelter in place, with some losing employment entirely. Bitcoin traders may need to liquidate at least some of their holdings to pay for everyday expenses, and yet it seems many are looking to purchase more.The crypto market has shown it can be every bit as volatile as traditional ones when the global economy is dealing with a pandemic.

41718," After BitMEX Meltdown, Should Shorting Be Banned on Crypto Exchanges? ",2020-03-22t21:56:00+00:00,5345,125,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) rapid 50% price drop in the wake of Coronavirus concerns aroused chatter around banning the ability for traders to assume short positions in cryptocurrency markets. Question is, would that be the right move?Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360Flash crash raises spectre of shorting bansOn March 12 Bitcoin dropped to prices not seen since April 2019, shedding half its value as fear gripped markets worldwide. The massive sell-off was instrumental in the carnage in which all cryptocurrencies except stablecoins suffered.Long positions worth around $1 billion were squeezed on Black Thursday, raising serious concerns about the long-term viability of leveraged and derivative trading in crypto markets. After the crash, Huobi’s derivatives trading platform, Huobi DM, introduced a partial liquidation feature aimed at providing a circuit breaker to limit trading losses when the market corrects sharply.Furthermore, a significant percentage of crypto trading volume occurs on BitMEX, OKEx, Binance Futures, and FTX, suggesting leveraged trading is having a disproportionate impact on spot prices.Last October, analytics data that crypto futures trading represented about 50% of the volume of spot trading. According to analytics firm Skew, before the dramatic slump, BTC futures trading had rolling open aggregate interest volumes around $5 billion.BTC Futures - Aggregate Open Interest.

Source: DatamishThe extraordinary circumstances buffeting markets could be mitigated if short selling was banned, but is this the right approach and even if so, is it feasible?Traditional markets get protection from short selling pressuresMarkets in Belgium, Greece, France, Italy, and Spain have all implemented bans on the short selling of some stocks, and Dutch authorities are considering following suit. In the wake of the last global financial crisis, markets globally placed short-selling bans on financial stocks to, in the words of the SEC, “protect the integrity and quality of the securities market and strengthen investor confidence.”The rationale behind halting short selling is to help shore up nervous markets in times of uncertainty and volatility. Studies have found, however, that banning investors from taking short positions actually harms markets.Alessandro Beber and Marco Pogano’s seminal study of short selling restrictions after the 2008 global financial crisis published in The Journal of Finance found that:“The short-selling bans imposed during the crisis are associated with a statistically and economically significant liquidity disruption, that is, with an increase in bid-ask spreads and in the Amihud illiquidity indicator, controlling for other variables.”In other words, it worsens volatility in the short-term. In the long-term, without the downward price pressure short sellers impose on markets, there is an absence of technical dampeners on speculative long trading. The cumulative risk here is the creation of asset bubbles.Princeton researchers Jose Scheinkman and Wei Xiong also reached a similar conclusion in their study titled Overconfidence and Speculative Bubbles. The researchers found that when shorting opportunities are constrained and valuation disagreements arise, optimism and overconfidence will combine to create price bubbles.In other words, without short pressure, traders tend to believe they will always have the opportunity to sell assets at a higher price than they bought them.Is banning shorting in crypto markets impractical?The effectiveness of banning shorting on crypto exchanges also relies on how practical it would be. Given the structure of the crypto trading industry, where numerous exchanges of varying sizes exist in a handful of jurisdictional environments, coordinating a set of rules would be virtually impossible.Any rules that weren’t enforceable industry-wide would create market distortions. If one exchange did not permit shorting but another did, traders would use the arbitrage opportunities that would arise by buying crypto where there was shorting pressure and selling it where there wasn’t.So even if shorting were introduced, it would risk inviting outlier exchanges to offer shorting opportunities to traders, thereby distorting price signals in an already small and young market.Shorting places healthy bearish pressure on crypto assets. Banning it may alleviate some short-term pain during periods of extreme volatility but it would almost certainly stem the ability for the industry to mature over the long-term.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

These include applications that manage and track health records, medical supplies, and medical data.Private-public initiatives involving blockchain have also proven effective, such as Alipay’s DLT platform, which allows charitable donations to be tracked by the public.In Hong Kong, insurers have looked to DLT as a way to streamline the paperwork processes surrounding medical claims, with Ant Financial launching a collective-claims platform to speed-up processing times."
41714, Blockchain Digital ID — Putting People in Control of Their Data ,2020-03-23t01:00:00+00:00,5806,301,"Although some people in life do an extremely convincing job of indicating otherwise, all humans have an identity. This identity comes in many forms, and as modern life has progressed, the ways in which people can identify have multiplied. Technology has now made it easier for people to explore and share their identities.But, at some point in the not-so-distant past, the internet overtook people’s ability to manage their identities online. Companies, notably the big data giants, have become the new gatekeepers. As the world enters a more data-conscious era, innovators in the tech industry believe that blockchain technology could be the solution.One of the most common goals across all blockchain-based identity projects is to put data back into the hands of those who created it. However, a decentralized identity network would look very different from the way data is gleaned now.Decentralization and encryption are key to securing personal data on blockchains. Instead of anonymous companies scooping up data once it is created, blockchain identity systems would store data on encrypted and decentralized networks. From there, users could grant limited access to third parties using keys.But, as anyone with a casual interest in tech will know, blockchain technology is cited as the miracle cure to most of society’s technological woes. It is expensive, difficult to explain to a regular person and, crucially, hard for companies to determine how to make it profitable. But that hasn’t stopped a significant number of use cases being developed and rolled out worldwide.Pay-as-you-go identityPayment and identity are closely linked. For hackers, compromising someone’s online identity, whether through password cracking or unlocking a large centralized database of personal details, is the digital equivalent of a gold mine. People’s online identities are also often attached to their financial details.Unfortunately for those whose details are leaked or hacked, online identity theft doesn’t require dodgy prosthetics or a wig. Hackers are constantly scouring the online realm for weaknesses, and stolen details are now one of the most commonly sold products on dark web marketplaces.This is where blockchain comes in. For Al Johnson, the CEO and founder of the Nuggets blockchain identity and payments company, blockchain ID systems give people the power to control their own identities:“A blockchain ID system adopts a user-centric approach, eliminating central points of failure by empowering individuals with self-sovereign possession over their own data.”For Johnson, payment and identity go hand in hand. When starting out in blockchain identity, Nuggets targeted identity and e-commerce. But Johnson soon realized that, as the ways in which people can pay online grow, so does the scope for identity solutions that can be solved.Johnson explained that as the company increasingly dealt with payments solutions and navigated the burgeoning regulatory structure surrounding identity online, he began to see the importance of blockchain and payments in creating strong digital identity:“To get the highest level of digital identity, you need to have transactions. You verify, you do biometrics, but the best thing you can get is to have the transaction proofs afterward. Now, when you put payment and identity together, you'll get a transaction proof probably three or four times a day.”Johnson explained to Cointelegraph that blockchain identity and payments create a strong digital identity through the number of verifications that are required in transactions from all parties involved:“When you make a payment, it’s checked with the merchant. It's being checked with payment and the gateway is being checked with the banks and the many other services you interact with. So, that trend is not only a transaction, it's a quadruple verification on each point.”EU is home to blockchain ID innovationEurope is fast becoming a fertile territory for blockchain ID projects. Although the EU has a number of initiatives to push forward blockchain innovation across its borders, Estonia and Catalonia are pioneering digital identity.Related: Interview With Daniel Marco on the State of Blockchain in CataloniaEstonia is perhaps the world’s leading country when it comes to blockchain technology. The country’s advanced digital ID system doesn’t stop at simply identifying Estonian citizens. The country’s e-services are now all available online, allowing for legal travel among EU states, national health insurance, proof of ID when logging in to banks, digital signatures, voting, medical records and more. Abbas Ali, global head of digital identity at R3, outlined his view to Cointelegraph that Estonia is leading the way in the blockchain ID sector:“In Estonia today, every citizen has access to a state-issued digital identity which can be used to provide digital signatures. Hence, it makes sense that Estonia would look to using blockchain technology to add a layer of security, trust and data integrity to for all the data it holds on its citizens. However, few details are available on the actual implementation, and it remains unclear how they’re actually using blockchain today.”Despite the political uncertainty that has surrounded Catalonia in recent years, its government has been at the forefront of blockchain ID research, most notably with the launch of IdentiCAT. IdentiCAT is a project that seeks to make citizens “exclusive owners” of their digital identity. At the time of the launch on Sept. 9, 2019, the Department for Digital Policies and Administration described the project:“IdentiCAT intends to be the first digital identity in Europe, which will be driven by the public sphere and self-managed by citizens themselves with full legal guarantee and effectiveness to operate not only with public authorities but also with private entities, thus fully ensuring compliance with personal data protection regulations.”Although Catalonia’s IdentiCAT project is ambitious, Ali believes that: “While it is definitely a positive step for the people of Catalonia, it is still too early to comment. Additionally, for digital identity to be truly meaningful, it would need support from the government on a national level.”Does blockchain ID need government support?Both blockchain and cryptocurrency are technologies that go hand in hand with libertarian ideas. For many people interested in decentralization, both for technology and finance, an important goal is to minimize the capabilities of the state to infringe on individual liberty.Johnson believes state involvement in blockchain ID projects is not necessarily to be avoided. He explained to Cointelegraph that it depends on the type of government involved and what the end goals of the project are, clarifying:“The U.K. has been particularly good looking at the overview [private blockchain ID projects] and then working forward. But, on the other hand, there’s China, which very much has state control. It’s possible to say, well, at least they get things done and they've moved toward their own cryptocurrency. It’s easy to see how that could be associated with identity and the debate as to whether state involvement could be good or bad. But then you have the opposite situation in America where there are regulators fighting against any change in terms of coming forward.”Ali was somewhat non-committal, explaining that there is no clear-cut example to demonstrate whether government involvement in blockchain ID would be necessary or not:“Identity is contextual, meaning the type of verification and data required to identify a legal person, natural person or thing varies based on the nature and context of the transaction. Some use-cases may require verification from governing bodies, yet others may not. The acceptance criteria for digital identity ultimately rests on the relying parties to define.”One of cryptocurrency’s most ambitious goals, especially given the current state of the markets, is to replace mainstream finance. For Ali, this is where blockchain ID projects and crypto differ greatly: “Blockchain-based digital identity is not meant to replace the role of governments in issuing citizens national identities.” Unlike central bank digital currencies, which many governmental and regulatory actors believe pose a direct threat to sovereign financial security, blockchain ID is not a decentralized approach to overcome the national identity of states, as Ali believes:“Blockchain simply provides a secure, privacy-preserving and scalable way of exchanging verified digital credentials between parties. In other words, blockchain-based identity systems are simply providing a platform to issue, exchange and verify digital identities. There is still a role for governments of sovereign state and other private organizations that issue verified identities today to issue those credentials in the digital world.”Despite saying that the suitability for governmental involvement depends on the use case and that there is no threat to state identity, Ali told Cointelegraph that: “Identity is a basic right for all and is needed today for accessing just about any type of public or private service.” He added that blockchain IDs will serve an important role in providing individuals with non-party political forms of identification:“As we move toward an increasingly digital world where basic services are moving online and people are interacting through new, purely digital channels, having a digital identity outside the control of any other parties is a fundamental right of all people and will have profound implications on individual liberty in the future.”How will blockchain ID develop?The growth of companies such as Nuggets, along with the examples of the governments of Catalonia and Estonia at a national level, has shown that there are ample use cases for blockchain ID. Ali explained to Cointelegraph that he expects significant growth in both the public and private sectors:“In the short run, we expect many more organizations to start investigating and deploying decentralized identity systems for their own internal use-cases. In the long run, we are seeing a lot of interest from the public sector in developing national digital identity infrastructure and potentially deploying it on a blockchain network.”"

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.Top Stories This WeekBitcoin price did not crash 60% due to coronavirus, Binance CEO saysIt’s fashionable to think that Black Thursday’s bloodbath on the crypto markets was caused by the coronavirus. But Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, disagrees. He believes the pandemic certainly triggered the current global meltdown — but added the mass sell-offs over recent weeks have proved that the world’s economy is far too weak. Many investors are hoarding cash as the uncertainty continues, but Zhao believes they will begin to broaden their portfolios in time. “Have people bought more Bitcoin yet? No, in most cases. Many of them are still panicking over toilet paper,” he said. BTC has come a long way over the past seven days — and, at the time of writing, it’s up by 12%, sitting pretty at about $6,000. This is some way off the highs of $6,900 that were achieved earlier in the week.Is Bitcoin correlated with the U.S. stock market?The debate now is about how closely Bitcoin’s performance is tied to the U.S. stock market. According to research by Santiment, the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 has now reached a two-year high — a bearish sign for the crypto markets. Historical data shows that such a high correlation is often accompanied by major downturns in BTC’s value. Santiment said: “With this pandemic, we are obviously seeing very similar movements in tandem as the coronavirus justifiably has investors in virtually every sector in a similar state of cautiousness.” Not everyone agrees with this analysis, though. Since the March 13 lows of $3,775, BTC has rallied by about 77%. Compare that with the S&P 500, which has fallen by 7.4%, and the Dow Jones, which is off by about 10% over the same period.Congress proposal to give everyone $2,000/month “strengthens case for Bitcoin”Countries around the world are now trying to figure out how to support those who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus — and how to keep their economies afloat. In the U.S., one Democratic representative in Congress has proposed giving $2,000 a month to every adult — and $1,000 to every child. Other nations are similarly exploring radical measures, with the U.K. recently announcing plans to pay 80% of the wages of workers on furlough. Some in the crypto community have been taken aback by these ideas. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph that the American proposal would cause massive inflation — and would even benefit Bitcoin in the long run if the Democrats won the White House in November.MakerDAO governance approves USDC stablecoin as collateralWe’ve got a little bit of time to switch gears and cover some different news in this week’s Hodler’s Digest. MakerDAO has added the USDC stablecoin as a third type of collateral, following an emergency vote this week. The move is designed to urgently increase Dai’s liquidity after how last week’s ETH flash crash created bad debt worth millions of dollars. A major downside with this decision is how it undercuts Dai’s selling point of exclusively being backed with decentralized assets. USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar and was created by Coinbase and Circle.Bakkt announces new direct payment integration with StarbucksBakkt — a platform best known for offering crypto derivatives — is diversifying into retail applications for digital assets. The company’s new app, Bakkt Cash, has now been added as a payment method to the Starbucks app on a trial basis. The ability to buy a caramel latte with an extra espresso shot using crypto is sure to cause plenty of excitement. Also this week, Bakkt managed to raise $300 million in a Series C funding round that was backed by Microsoft’s venture capital arm and the Intercontinental Exchange. The company is developing an app where cash, cryptocurrencies and loyalty points can be stored in one place and used to make purchases. Unfortunately, it’s unclear how much this new Bakkt feature will be used by Starbucks customers, with the coffee chain closing its locations to eat-in customers because of the coronavirus.Winners and LosersAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $6,093.87, Ether at $128.94 and XRP at $0.15. The total market cap is at $170,237,547,952.Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Swipe, Numeraire and MCO.

Rob Sluymer said that “lower highs and lower lows are in place for Bitcoin” after investors practically fled every asset class — and this leaves it in a “compromised, potentially vulnerable long-term profile.” Looking ahead, he added: “Bitcoin will likely need months of consolidation to repair the technical damage now in place.” Another prediction this week came from eToro analyst Simon Peters, who predicted that the coronavirus crisis could strengthen Bitcoin.FUD of the WeekWoman arrested for stealing $480,000 from crypto exchange she co-foundedA woman has been arrested for stealing 63.5 BTC from the cryptocurrency exchange she had previously co-founded. Ayushi Jain used to work for Bitcipher Labs and was arrested in the Indian city of Bengaluru. The 26-year-old was accused of stealing the cryptocurrency — worth about $480,000 — in two unauthorized transactions on Jan. 11 and March 11. Ayushi has since confessed to the theft, and the stolen funds have been recovered by detectives. A senior police officer said: “We seized a laptop which contained the history, showing how Ayushi used the passphrase and stole money in installments between January and March.”Less than 1% of Australians used crypto to pay for services in 2019A study by the Reserve Bank of Australia suggests that cryptocurrencies aren’t as popular as previously thought. The survey revealed that less than 1% of Australians used digital assets like Bitcoin to make a consumer payment in 2019. This is despite the fact that electronic transactions are becoming increasingly popular, and over 80% of those polled had heard about cryptocurrencies. In terms of the most-used alternative payment methods, crypto was third behind “buy now, pay later” services and “tap and go” mobile payments.Bitfinex to delist 87 crypto trading pairs aiming to improve liquidityBitfinex has announced that it is removing 87 crypto trading pairs due to low liquidity levels. The major cryptocurrency exchange hopes the measure will improve liquidity elsewhere and help it move toward a more streamlined and optimized trading experience. In a statement provided to Cointelegraph, Bitfinex said: “The decision was taken after monitoring [the pairs] for six weeks and finding a consistent low level of liquidity. We take this type of action to concentrate trading in fewer pairs.”Best Cointelegraph FeaturesDoes Bitcoin have intrinsic value or is it based on thin air?Bitcoin was dealt a blow after the newly appointed Bank of England governor said that Bitcoin has no extrinsic value — echoing similar remarks by billionaires including Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett.

The initial bid for each lot was 250 MKR, with each subsequent bid decreasing by a minimum of 3%.The auctions have raised 2 million DAI from 25 unique bidders with an average price of 269.3 MKR per lot."
41709, Binance.US CEO: Coronavirus Quarantine Drove Volume Resurgence in Asia ,2020-03-22t22:00:00+00:00,3312,128,"Catherine Coley, the CEO of Binance US, revealed that the coronavirus quarantine in Asia drove a surge in trade volume during an interview with Bloomberg on March 16.On the subject of the recent correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500, Coley asserts that both the traditional cryptocurrency markets are playing out a familiar long-term cycle.She states that the markets are experiencing what she terms the “CRIC cycle” — where “crisis” yields a market “response,” followed by “improvements,” and then a return to “complacency,” before the cycle then repeats:“So, in the regular traditional asset classes, as with Bitcoin, you’re seeing that complacency in the market turn into crisis, creating panic. That’s going to generate sell-off across the board.”Bitcoin is resilient to real-world supply-chain shocksShe emphasizes that the cryptocurrency markets are underpinned by “technology that we can trade on 24/7, regardless of our environment,” describing the ecosystem as impervious to the “supply chain problems that we are seeing from national traded stock.”“You also saw [...] a resurgence of trading volumes taking place in Asia when the [...] quarantine took place. So I think you will see the same thing happen in the U.S. when we get more firm guidelines on what the quarantine means for America,” she said.“I think you see Bitcoin being something that we can continue to engage with, regardless of the safety and concerns of the U.S. and globally,“ Coley adds.Current BTC prices are affordable for institutionsColey argues that the cryptocurrency ecosystem has matured significantly over the last year, adding that current prices may lure institutional investment:“We’ve seen such a maturing from last year in this space, with institutions being able to identify who are really the players in the crypto space, and now the prices are now affordable for those institutions to come in.”When questioned as to whether Bitcoin’s perceived status as a ‘safe-haven’ asset has been challenged by recent market volatility, Coley states, “I think that markets are still trying to figure out what exactly ‘safe-haven’ means.”However, Coley predicts that Bitcoin’s lack of dependence on the physical world will see it continue to trade with strength despite global quarantine efforts and economic challenges faced amid the coronavirus threat.Since launching in September 2019, Binance.US has steadily increased the number of crypto assets listed on its platform. In March, the exchange announced support for Tezos (XTZ) and started accepting USD Coin (USDC) deposits."
41708, Bank of China Continues Anti-Crypto Narrative on WeChat ,2020-03-22t20:00:00+00:00,5448,156,"Financial markets are facing their worst crisis since 1929 and people are looking for alternatives to protect themselves from the crash. One option being considered by many is cryptocurrency.In response, Bank of China has continued its anti-crypto narrative in a long post titled “3.15 Protetion of Financial Consumption Rights and Interests”. The post was published on the bank’s official WeChat account on March 22.In the post, bank officials warn the public about cryptocurrency investment, calling out the three main scams seen on crypto exchanges. The bank stated:“First of all, the amount of fraud transactions with bots is serious. The average turnover rate of the top three overseas crypto currency exchanges is much higher than that of foreign licensed exchanges. Second, market manipulation exists in these exchanges where forced leveraged trading eventually causes the exchanges to explode.Third, money laundering is a big issue.”The Bank of China post also pointed out that the claim that Bitcoin is a safe haven is false, as it is too volatile. The bank urges people to protect themselves from following the crowd by abstaining from crypto investment.China has never liked cryptocurrency tradingAs Cointelegraph reported last year, Alipay banned transactions related to Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.At the beginning of 2018, local authorities started cracking down on market-making platforms and other “exchange-like” services relating to cryptocurrency.In September 2017, Chinese regulators placed a ban on local cryptocurrency exchanges, and sought to crack down on all domestic cryptocurrency trading.Bitcoin is resilientCointelegraph's analysis on March 21 indicates that Bitcoin was designed for a financial crisis and so far it’s working well."
41707, Exchange’s Live AMA to Unveil Plans for New USDT Perpetual Contracts ,2020-03-22t17:35:00+00:00,3734,46,"A derivatives exchange has announced it is taking part in an “ask me anything” livestream on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel.Bybit's broadcast is going to be taking place on March 24 — and presently, the transmission is scheduled to commence at 11 a.m. EST.The exchange’s CEO, Ben Zhou, is set to make a special announcement during the livestream: the upcoming launch of USDT perpetual contracts.Viewers are being invited to submit their questions and get expert answers. The AMA will be hosted by Cointelegraph’s Jackson Dumont.USDT perpetual contracts, explainedUnder these contracts, USDT is used as both the quote currency and settlement currency. Long and short positions can be held concurrently and with differing levels of leverage. Bybit emphasizes its goal is to replicate the underlying spot market, but with elevated leverages. The changes mean that users only need USDT as capital in their wallets.It is a well-known fact that many major cryptocurrencies (if not all) are susceptible to volatility — with prices constantly changing, often without reason. As USDT is a stablecoin, the company notes this asset “is relatively stable from the U.S. dollar traders’ perspective.”Other features offered through Bybit include auto margin replenishment, helping to protect holdings against fluctuations in pricing. Unrealized profit and loss can also be shared across positions and contracts — meaning floating profit from a BTC/USDT pairing can be used to execute a trade in ETH/USDT. Floating profits can also be used to prevent vulnerable positions from being liquidated.More insights from Bybit hereBybit has also beefed up its chart features — unveiling three brand-new options that enable users to open positions quickly, which reduces the chance of them missing out on trades during times of high volatility. Positions can also be closed or inverted as a matter of urgency. The company adds that its margin requirements for most tiers “are significantly lower than our competitors and a more substantial step-up for each level.”Plenty of enhancements are in the pipeline, and the derivatives exchange is also gearing up to launch insurance and an advanced conditional order system.Trading for everyoneBybit says there are several features that help it stand out in the crowded market of crypto exchanges.Founded in March 2018 and headquartered in Singapore, the Bybit team says it is determined to serve everyone — from individual retail clients to professional derivatives traders.Customer services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and in multiple languages. Perpetual contracts are offered across several trading pairs, including BTC/USD, ETH/USD, XRP/USD and EOS/USD.Bybit’s team of founders includes a rich array of professionals from the forex industry, investment banking, and specialists who were early adopters of blockchain technology.The exchange claims that a state-of-the-art matching engine paves the way for 100,000 transactions per second — with server availability of up to 99.99%, meaning that there is practically no downtime.When it comes to the company’s philosophy, Bybit continues to stick to its ethos: “Listen, care and improve to provide the best possible trading experience and create a faster, fairer and more human trading environment.”For now, preparations are in hand for the YouTube livestream this Tuesday, where loyal Bybit users and newcomers will learn more about what’s in store for the crypto exchange in the coming weeks and months.Learn more about BybitDisclaimer.

41706," Celo Alliance Is out to Challenge Libra, Hoping for Less Red Tape ",2020-03-22t17:40:00+00:00,2854,98,"Several members of the Facebook-backed Libra Project have announced their alliance with a rival stablecoin project known as Celo. Since the middle of March, members that have joined the Celo Alliance for Prosperity include, among many others, Coinbase Ventures, Anchorage Mercy Corps, Andreessen Horowitz and Bison Trails Co. The shift in interest from one project to the other may signal the ultimate demise of Libra, as several companies have departed the project.In October of last year, the Libra Association took a major hit when five of its most prominent backers — PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay — left. Voicing concerns about their reputation being tainted, these major backers claimed that Facebook had exaggerated the openness of regulators to the Libra project.Although one of the heads of the Libra project claimed that the withdrawal of these companies would not have an impact, it is clear that major regulatory setbacks are delaying, and possibly even endangering, the future of Libra.What is Celo?The word “celo” means “purpose” in Esperanto, and the Celo Alliance is a non-profit organization that aims to facilitate financial inclusion to billions of people worldwide by developing an open-source financial ecosystem with its own blockchain, stablecoin, and varied financial tools and services.Its associated blockchain is proof-of-stake, which is similar to Ethereum in many ways, taking advantage of smart contract functionalities and features, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine runtime environment and a native accounting program, Celo Gold.All tokens created on the platform, including Celo Gold (cGold) and Celo Dollar (cUSD), are ERC-20 tokens. Such tokens are already common in smart contract development and allow developers to create interoperability between the Celo and other various Ethereum blockchain versions.Celo envisions the development of a basket of other stablecoins besides cGold and cUSD. These will be pegged to different fiat currencies, all backed by a reserve of crypto assets — Celo Gold, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) — held by the Celo Foundation. Celo Gold can be converted into Celo Dollar and any future stablecoins, as one Celo Dollar can be burnt for the equivalent in Celo Gold. Users of the platform will be able to pay transaction fees with any stablecoin of their choosing.Who are the supporters?Although the Celo platform has been in development since 2017, it has recently gained popularity with the newly formed Celo Alliance for Prosperity because several supporters of the Libra Association have now also joined it — including Coinbase Ventures, Anchorage Mercy Corps, Andreessen Horowitz and Bison Trails.With 50 founding members and an estimated reach of 400 million people, the Celo Alliance comprises several prominent players and infrastructure support, such as Carbon, MoonPay, Ledger, GiveDirectly, Grameen Foundation, Maple and Polychain Capital where each member has a unique role. Cointelegraph spoke to Joe Lallouz, the founder and CEO of Bison Trails, an infrastructure-as-a-service company and Celo Alliance member. He explained:“Bison Trails’ involvement benefits the protocols we support because we make it easier for a wider and more diverse group of companies, social impact partners, universities and organizations to participate in the network without having to develop any of the technical core competency or protocol-specific blockchain infrastructure.”At the moment, the Celo Alliance website shows 60 members from around the world, amassing collective experience in many different fields. Over the years, Celo has received $36 million in two private funding rounds — $30 million in 2019 and $6.5 million in 2018 — with noticeable backers like Polychain Capital and Coinbase and angel investors like Reid Hoffman and Jack Dorsey.How does it work?According to the whitepaper, the platform is designed to be used on smartphones, highlighting the notion that a smartphone is the best way to bring financial inclusion to individuals in developing countries. Studies have also shown that smartphone ownership has been on the rise in emerging economies, giving more people internet access and contributing to better literacy rates and education, as well as job opportunities and economic growth.Celo uses a lightweight identity layer, enabling those who use the Celo wallet to identify themselves and securely transact with others. Through this identity layer, phone numbers are linked to the wallet which allows users to issue payments directly to other users listed in the smartphone’s contact list. Celo has been coined as the “WhatsApp for money” by one of its backers, Polychain Capital Founder and CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee.How is Celo bringing prosperity?With the colorful slogan “Money can be beautiful,” Celo’s philosophy is grounded in the concept of gift economy and inspired by the work of Charles Eisenstein’s Sacred Economics. The Celo Foundation aims to empower anyone who owns a smartphone anywhere in the world, facilitate humanitarian help, give people access to financial services, and pay merchants. Although these concepts aren’t new, Celo seeks to make use of its partners to develop an infrastructure to implement its goals.The Celo protocol supports a new type of monetary ecology, in which stablecoins can share the same reserve and help stabilize the price of the other stablecoins. Meanwhile, it also allows the creation of a stablecoin pegged not only to global but also to local and regional currencies. One of the benefits of this is preventing price volatility when using a global currency for local transactions in regions where consumer price dynamics are unstable.In these partitioned reserve cases, suited for local and regional currencies, a third-party creates the token and holds 50% of the reserves for that same token — 25% Celo Gold and 25% of a local reserve. This can open up the possibility of distributing some of the local reserve currency to community members, creating a social dividend that incentivizes people to adopt the local currency.The Celo blockchain is currently at a testnet stage known as “Baklava” and incentivizes everyone who wishes to participate in the network to engage with the Great Celo Stake Off.Libra vs. Celo rivalryBoth Celo and Libra aim to bring financial inclusion to billions of people through the use of stablecoin technology. Combining the best of both Libra’s structure and Ethereum’s capabilities, Celo appears to be in a better position to launch its network in comparison to Libra, which is facing numerous legal hurdles and the loss of investor confidence.The two projects show similarities, as both plan to have the value of their tokens linked to a basket of different fiat currencies. Both projects have also decided to create a camp incubator. But what sets the two projects apart?One of the major differences is their reach. What made Facebook’s Libra exciting (or scary to some) was the level of exposure the social media platform has in relation to 2 billion people that use its service. Celo claims to have an estimated reach of 400 million people, which is also quite impressive on its own.The second major difference is their approach. Facebook is a private company looking to create its own stablecoin on a centralized platform. The Libra hybrid blockchain allows anyone to build on the technology although only invited members can run nodes and help the network reach consensus. Celo, on the other hand, is an open-source project run by a non-profit organization foundation. Due to its decentralized nature, Celo may not face the same regulatory barriers as Libra.This does not mean it will be smooth sailing from here on out either. Chuck Kimble, head of business development of Celo and also the head of the Celo Alliance, stated that the most serious threats are the “banking infrastructure improving faster than we expect” and “mobile adoption, or LTE, data not expanding on their current trajectory.” While some may look at Celo and Libra as competitors in a limited market, Lallouz has another outlook:“We support both of these projects and we believe they can both coexist while furthering similar goals. Many blockchain projects, not just Libra and Celo, are trying to make the world more financially inclusive. As a long-term technologist, engineer and entrepreneur, the idea that there’s only one protocol that can do this and solve for all the needs of the future, seems naive.”Celo, Libra or something else: The future of financial inclusionFacebook’s Libra and the Celo Alliance for Prosperity have many things in common, including goals, methodology and overall strategy. However, Celo’s financial ecosystem offers more transparency and trust over Libra’s centralized approach, which means the former is more aligned with crypto’s ethos. Nevertheless, Facebook’s internet presence could give Libra a clear advantage in the race to global adoption despite its current regulatory struggles.It is clear that financial inclusion through mobile devices will come to small communities and emerging economies in the upcoming years. However, it is impossible to predict whether these financial services will be provided by projects like Celo or Libra or even by traditional financial institutions with their Central Bank Digital Currencies."
41702, Ethereum-Based SkyWeaver Game Launches Season 0 ,2020-03-22t18:00:00+00:00,4202,101,"SkyWeaver, the forthcoming free-to-play blockchain-based card game from Horizon Blockchain Games, has opened its final closed-beta season.On March 21, Horizon announced that season 0 of SkyWeaver had commenced. The season will be live until the launch of SkyWeaver’s open-beta version.Horizon opens season 0 of SkyWeaverThe collectible card game uses Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as in-game items — which players can either use within the game or trade on secondary markets.The in-game items earned during season 0 will not be able to be used once SkyWeaver enters open-beta. However, players who rank among the top 500 in either of the game’s modes will be gifted a ‘gold card’ that can be used in the open-beta version.Horizon expects to launch in open-beta before 2021.Players can earn and own Ethereum-based in-game digital assetsSkyWeaver features two distinct modes of gameplay. In ‘discovery’, players are given a random deck of cards that they do not keep, but can be used to earn gold cards by winning. Once the player owns enough cards, they can play in ‘constructed’ mode — where they can choose to build their deck using the cards that they possess.When live, the game will feature ‘normal’, ‘silver’, and ‘gold’ cards. Normal cards are hosted within the game, while the silver and gold cards are owned by players.Silver cards can be purchased from Horizon, while Gold cards are earned as rewards in-game — and are the only type of card to feature scarcity, owing to a controlled rate of release.However, Horizon reserves the right to modify the stats of a card should it prove overpowered or disruptive to gameplay — which could unexpectedly impact the market value of gold cards.Horizon receives backing from Reddit co-founderOn March 7, Horizon announced that it had secured $5 million in a fundraising round led by Initialized Capital — the investment firm co-founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.In a blog post, Peter Kieltyka, the co-founder of Blockchain Games stated that the funds will be used to launch SkyWeaver.Initialized Capital also led Horizon’s $3.75 million seed round in 2019."

41701," Attestiv CEO on Using DLT to Fight Fake News, Insurance Fraud, and Deep-Fakes ",2020-03-22t17:00:00+00:00,1653,100,"On March 18, Attestiv, a firm combating digital fraud and deep-fakes using blockchain technology, announced that it had secured funds exceeding $2 million in a seed offering.Cointelegraph recently spoke to Attestiv’s CEO, Nico Vekiarides, to analyze his thoughts on blockchain’s role in combating fake news and digital fraud in the insurance industry.Cointelegraph: Can we get an overview of how the Attestiv platform works?Nicos Vekiarides: Attestiv provides authenticity for digital photos, videos, and documents by registering a fingerprint to a blockchain when a digital asset is captured.While it does not contain the asset itself, the digital fingerprint securely accounts for all of the asset content and key metadata such as timestamp and location. It also includes other optional attributes such as user or context-sensitive information. At any point in the future, the asset can be compared in real-time against the fingerprint in the ledger to determine if it is altered in any way.Behind the scenes, the full process involves AI, heuristics, and even forensics to help track and determine authenticity, chain of custody, and even understand slight changes, reformatting, resizing, etc. Because we are ledger-agnostic, we work with both public and private blockchains or ledgers, and will be announcing partners soon.CT: What are some applications for the Attestiv platform?NV: Our initial use cases focus on the insurance ecosystem, where there are numerous stakeholders who don’t always share a common system or trust.Our customers range from insurance brokers, adjusters, carriers and even law enforcement. The insurance industry already faces $30-$40B in property &amp; casualty fraud in the US alone, (according to the FBI).With digital transformation and self-service mobile user interfaces either in roll-out or on the horizon, there is a growing need to detect and prevent fraud, particularly based on recent advancements in AI-based photo and video editing tools — that are available to virtually anyone.CT: Are there particular projects that portions of the $2 million raise has been designated towards?NV: Absolutely. We are expanding our perceptual fingerprinting technology to cover more use cases, such as video that has been redacted, transcoded or lossy. We are building forensic technology that works in tandem with our blockchain-based tamper prevention. Finally, we are creating optimal user experiences for our clients either through apps or APIs that seamlessly integrate into existing applications.CT: Can you comment on the role of blockchain technology in combating fake news?NV: Blockchain can play a big role in combating fake news to the extent the industry is willing to adopt a new standard for capturing photos and videos.To some extent, the lines get blurred when editorializing enters the picture — and there are certain instances where the best we can do is create a provable endorsement of a news article, rather than prove its authenticity.Social media has been scrambling to create order around this space, but regulations around deep-fakes are still in early formative stages and, quite frankly, evolving on a regular basis. For instance, what constitutes satire vs. fake news can sometimes be perceived differently by different people.We’ve learned fake news can be very problematic during a pandemic. Early on, a video purportedly showing the Wuhan market where the COVID-19 strain materialized was debunked and found to be shot somewhere in the Philippines. But the truth emerged after a significant amount of sharing.Clearly people are more vulnerable and more likely to believe photos, videos, or print when they are in a panic. Being able to discern between what’s real, what’s fake, and what’s opinion is very important under these circumstances."
41699," Top 5 Cryptos This Week (Mar 22): Bitcoin (BTC), DASH, BSV, BCH, CRO ",2020-03-22t16:07:00+00:00,4683,142,"The world is in a state of panic due to the coronavirus pandemic. People are fighting over toilet paper, which shows the extent of nervousness. At such a time, even investors are likely to show irrational behaviors.The governments are attempting to calm the markets by supplying enough liquidity, which is likely to run into trillions of dollars. However, even after that, the world economy might slip into a global recession.The head of operations at Genesis Mining Philip Salter said that if the economic crisis does not deepen further, it “will not have major implications for Bitcoin.” However, if the crisis deepens and skepticism builds up, it might be favorable for Bitcoin because then people will see it as a hedge against the banking system.Crypto market data weekly view. Source: Coin360CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao said that the coronavirus pandemic “is just a trigger, not the root cause” for the current economic meltdown. This shows that the economy was on a weak footing because a strong economy should have withstood a few shocks. Zhao believes that the investors will stop hoarding cash at some point in time and will diversify their portfolio and Bitcoin will benefit from it because it is not “broken”. However, it might not happen in a hurry because “changes don’t happen immediately when a mass population is involved,” Zhao added.The cryptocurrencies are attempting a recovery from their recent lows. Let’s analyze the top five performers of the past seven days to see whether the recovery will pick up steam or fizzle out.DASH/USDDash (DASH) is the best performer of this week with a stellar rally of about 40%. The Dash Core Group announced the release of a new Dash platform v0.11, “which includes a significant update to Evonet, the testing environment for platform functionality.” Can Dash start a sustained recovery from the current levels? Let’s study its chart.DASH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe DASH/USD pair has been trading inside a falling wedge for more than a year. The positive thing to note is that whenever the price bounces off the support line of the wedge, it manages to move up to the resistance line of the wedge.Another positive development on the chart is the RSI, which is showing signs of forming a bullish divergence. All these signs suggest that the pair might turn positive in the short-term and move up to $150. The moving averages might offer a minor resistance but we expect them to be crossed.If the momentum can carry the price above the wedge, it will be a huge positive as it will signal the start of a new uptrend. However, if the bears defend the resistance line once again, the pair will extend its stay inside the wedge.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the moving averages and plummets below the support line of the wedge. However, we give it a low probability of occurring.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) is the second-best performer of the past seven days with a rally of about 29%. In Kleiman v. Wright Lawsuit, the U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled that Craig Wright only needs to pay 20% of the legal fees requested by the estate of the late-Dave Kleiman.BSV USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe BSV/USD pair is attempting to break out of the descending channel. Just above the channel, it is likely to face resistance at the 20-week EMA at $189, which has flattened out. The RSI is also close to the midpoint, which suggests a balance between the bulls and bears.If the pair turns down from $189, it might drop to $78.506 and remain range-bound between these two levels for the next few days.The advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push the price above the 20-week EMA. Above this level, a move to $279, equal to the depth of the channel is possible. If this level is also crossed, the next level to watch out for is $337.80. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below $78.506, a drop to $38.528 is possible.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH), with a gain of about 19% in the past seven days turned out to be the third-best performer. The world’s biggest stablecoin Tether (USDT) launched on the Bitcoin Cash network during the week.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe BCH/USD pair has been range-bound between $166.25 and $515.35 for the past many months. Currently, the pair has been falling inside a descending channel, which shows that bears have the upper hand.However, if the bulls can push the price above the channel, it will be the first indication of a likely change in trend. Above the channel, the bulls might face stiff resistance at the moving averages close to $300.If the price turns down from the moving averages, the pair might remain range-bound for a few days between $166.25 and $300. On the other hand, if the bulls can scale and sustain the price above the moving averages, it will open the doors for a move to $515.35.Our view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the support at $166.25. If this level cracks, the downtrend can extend to $100.BTC/USDThe last financial crisis in 2008 resulted in the birth of Bitcoin (BTC) and the current crisis due to the coronavirus outbreak is likely to cement its place. After the sharp drop on March 12, many questioned the relevance of Bitcoin as a safe haven. However, after the initial panic, the largest cryptocurrency has come back smartly in the past few days.Platinum Account Manager at eToro Simon Peters believes that all the cash that is being pumped into the system will search assets to invest after the virus cases reduce and Bitcoin is likely to be one of the beneficiaries.Chief investment officer of Ikigai Asset Management Travis Kling said that Bitcoin “is an insurance policy against the largest monetary experiment in human history.” While the fundamentals look positive, let’s look at the charts and analyze the technicals.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe BTC/USD pair has been trading inside a large symmetrical triangle since 2017. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support line of the triangle while the bears are attempting to sink the price below it.If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance at $6,435, the rebound is likely to pick up momentum. The next level to watch on the upside is $10,500, which is just below the resistance line of the triangle.A break above the triangle will be a huge positive as it will signal the start of a new uptrend. Above the triangle, the first target to watch out for is $14,000 and above it $16,000. Therefore, traders can wait for the price to sustain above $6,435 before buying for the long-term.Contrary to our assumption, if the pair turns down from $6,435 and breaks below the support of the triangle, it will be a huge negative.CRO/USDCrypto.com Coin (CRO) rounded off the list of the top performers with a rally of about 12%.

According to the company, the cards will be shipped to the rest of Europe over the next few weeks.CRO USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe CRO/USD pair has been trading inside the $0.025258-$0.080 range for the past few months. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the support of the range. The first level to watch on the upside is the 20-week EMA at $0.045.If the price turns down from this level, the pair might remain range-bound between $0.045-$0.025258 for the next few days. A break below the support of the range will be a huge negative as it will start a new downtrend.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the 20-week EMA, the pair can gradually move up to $0.060 and above it to $0.080.

41697, Did BTC Miners Crash Bitcoin Price With 51 Days Before the Halving? ,2020-03-22t15:22:00+00:00,35162,222,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has started to show strength in its recovery since the black Thursday selloff this past week, but is this something we can expect to continue? Or is this a dead cat bounce on the way down to lower lows?In today's analysis I’m looking not only at the charts, but also at the possibility of large Bitcoin miners being the cause of the 50% price drop on March 12, after supporting data emerged last week suggesting that short-term holders sold a whopping 281,000 BTC, which resulted in the crash.Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comDid miners dump over a quarter of a million BTC?In an article published by Coinmetrics on March 17, on-chain data supported the fact that short-term BTC holders were most likely responsible for the selling rather than new holders.The figures they quoted included 281,000 BTC was on the move after 30 days of holding, compared to 4,131 that hadn’t been touched for over a year before being moved.This data might suggest to some that it was weak hands that FOMO bought in during Bitcoin's 30% price rise at the beginning of 2020. However, one has to consider the possible motives at play for such a large amount of Bitcoin being sold off cheap.This to me opens up the very real possibility that the same people responsible for Bitcoin's price rise this year, were the same people responsible for its fall.As can be seen in the chart below, Bitcoin had been trending in a downward parallel channel since June 2019 — a trend that seemed to bottom on Jan. 4, 2020, which saw the Bitcoin price take off in a new ascending channel.This new impetus for Bitcoin’s price was welcomed, but not questioned. Why did Bitcoin start to rise? Was it the upcoming halving, which is now just 51 days away? Was it the mining difficulty increase? Was it renewed institutional interest? However, what if it was all of these things combined, but with a twist.What if the miners stopped selling Bitcoin?There are 1,800 new Bitcoins mined every day, and between the period of Jan. 4 and Mar 12, there would have been 122,400 Bitcoin mined. This is about 50% of the amount that was revived by short term holders, and you don’t get more short term than freshly mined BTC.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewWhy would miners crash the market?I’m not going to pretend that I know any of this for a fact, this is just a theory with a lot of supporting data.But I will throw a few reasons that would make sense for larger miners to crash the market before continuing with my analysis.To liquidate leveraged competitors (many smaller miners hedge on leverage platforms like Bitmex);To increase their market share ahead of the halving (because of the above);To shake out big manipulators (PlusToken scammers, Institutional investors) prior to the halving.I believe the above to be plausible reasons, especially if you consider how much hashing power comes out of China, a nation that pretty much has a crystal ball when it comes to the Coronavirus outbreak, as the first cases where being reported there back in November 2019.This almost creates a perfect storm of conditions to execute the black swan event that was able to simultaneously gain dominance in the market, and regain control of the price. After all, if miners have no control over the price, then the halving will have no impact.If in doubt, zoom outBTC USD daily chart Source: TradingViewWhen you zoom out on the Bitcoin 1-day chart, it’s almost obvious where miners could have stopped selling. The breakout at the beginning of the year just looks like a bump in the road, as we have since resumed the same downward channel we were in for the entire second half of 2019.We’ll never really know whether or not the above scenario is true because of the selloff. However, one thing that is definite is that the price bounced off the support of the descending channel at $4,400 as anticipated in last week's analysis, so I am keeping these levels in mind looking forward to the week ahead.At present, the price is holding above the middle of the channel, which is around $5,800. However, should this level fail to hold, then I expect $4,200 to be tested next week.Should $5,800 continue to hold, then $7,200 is the key level of resistance for Bitcoin to push past and flip to support to be rid of this descending channel once and for all.Mining difficulty reductionBTC mining difficulty. Source: BTC.comSince the beginning of 2020, we have largely had the mining difficulty increase. This, in turn, seemingly saw the price rise, and as such, it seemed like a valid indicator.However, next week we are set to see the year’s first double-digit adjustment, and unfortunately, it’s a negative one of -10.54%.Only time will tell if this will have a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin.The yearly trend suggests that it might also just be correcting itself after such a dramatic selloff on the day it last increased. Bitcoin has a history of punishing its holders prior to big rewards, and the next chart might help you visualize what could be in store over the coming weeks and months.BTC Rainbow Chart Source: Blockchain CentreSimilar to the stock to flow ratio chart, only this one I feel helps convey an important message, and that message is “Keep buying Bitcoin at these levels.”Whilst this chart isn’t intended to be financial advice, and like the S2F model has most likely been based on hindsight, what it does show is potentially how long we might remain in the blue “fire sale” zone both ahead and beyond the halving.As a Bitcoin hodler and trader, I take great comfort in one thing shown on this chart. There are many more buying opportunities than there are selling opportunities, so should the price of Bitcoin continue to slide next week, try to view it as an opportunity to buy more, rather than reflecting on how much of a rekt pleb you feel right now.Bullish scenarioI said it last week, I’ll say it again, the CME gap still exists at $9,165. Whilst it feels almost impossible right now, 90% of CME gaps still fill, so there’s always a possibility.However, being more realistic and looking at the week ahead, if Bitcoin can hold $5,800 as support then all eyes are on $7,200 as the key level to break out from.From here, I would expect the next level of resistance to be present around $8,000 before we can even start to think about $10,000 again.Bearish scenarioWe can’t completely ignore all the global turmoil right now. Thus, if $5,800 fails to hold, I think it’s highly probable that we will revisit $4,200.Falling below $4,200 is not a scenario I believe we need to consider. However, if this were to break, then $2,760 would be the last level of support I’d be looking at, as this would represent an 80% retracement from last year's high of $13,800. If it fails to bounce there, then I would completely expect Bitcoin to go to sub $1,000 levels.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Intermex chief executive Robert Lisv explained:“So, you won’t really see us leveraging Ripple in our core markets. I think it will bring us more growth in newer markets in places where we’re exploring going into ancillary products.”Intermex to use Ripple for ""ancillary products"" in ""newer markets""Ripple announced its partnership with Intermex on Feb. 5, with its press release emphasizing that the deal would “enabl[e] faster cross-border payments between the U.S. and Mexico.”Despite Ripple's claims, Intermex's CEO asserted: ""Ripple will not be an answer for places like Mexico. We’re very proud about the relationships we have there.""Intermex has recently sought to expand its presence in Africa, suggesting that is likely the market where the payments company will employ Ripple’s technologies.Moneygram immediately liquidates all XRP receivedIntermex is not Ripple’s only partner to reveal aspects of its partnership that likely have been poorly received by XRP holders.In a recent interview, a representative of U.S.-based payments firm, MoneyGram, revealed that the firm liquidates all XRP received through its partnership as soon as the tokens are received.During 2019, MoneyGram sold $11.3 million worth of XRP — increasing the monthly sell pressure on the XRP markets by $1 million.Ripple announced its partnership with MoneyGram in January 2018, with the deal intended to increase settlement speeds and bolster liquidity on the payments platform. MoneyGram began using Ripple’s technology in August 2019.Per a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MoneyGram “is compensated by Ripple in XRP for developing and bringing liquidity to foreign exchange markets, facilitated by the ODL platform, and providing a reliable level of foreign exchange trading activity.”In November 2019, MoneyGram estimated that 10% of its Mexican peso volume is executed using Ripple’s 'On-Demand Liquidity' platform."
41695, Bitcoin’s Correlation With S&P500 At 2-Year High Amid the Coronavirus Crisis ,2020-03-22t14:24:00+00:00,5765,121,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) correlation with the S&P 500 is at a 2-year high. This is a bearish sign for the cryptocurrency market.Cryptocurrency market research firm, Santiment, pointed out that the recent market downturn resulted in a high correlation between Bitcoin and the traditional financial markets in a March 20 tweet.According to Santiment, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional equity cyclically moves from negative to positive values. The coronavirus pandemic, according to the firm, resulted in the growth of this correlation:“With this pandemic, we are obviously seeing very similar movements in tandem as the coronavirus justifiably has investors in virtually every sector in a similar state of cautiousness.”High correlation is a bearish signSantiment explained in its tweets that historic Bitcoin data shows that when the correlation with the S&P 500 is high, it is typically accompanied by major downturns in the cryptocurrency markets. The firm also notes:“Any subsequent bounce-backs over time are typically foreshadowed by a growing ‘decoupling’ between BTC and the S&P. We should see a clear sign of an impending uptrend when this correlation line is beginning to approach 0 (or lower) again.”Investor sentiment regaining positivity for BitcoinWhen Bitcoin has first seen its recent downturn earlier this month, Bitcoin bull and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said that investors have lost confidence in Bitcoin. He explained:“[Bitcoin] was always a confidence game. All crypto is. And it appears global confidence in just about anything has evaporated.”Still, some prominent figures in the cryptocurrency market have regained confidence in Bitcoin, following the asset’s recent rebound. The founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, Raoul Pal, recently said that he is quite bullish on Bitcoin after the asset recovered by nearly 80% in just one week."

41687," Zimbabwe U-Turns on Crypto, Looking to Stabilize Local Economy ",2020-03-22t11:30:00+00:00,10561,382,"The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the country’s central bank, is considering a regulatory sandbox for crypto companies in an apparent change from its previous anti-cryptocurrency stance. The proposed sandbox is reportedly part of a broader agenda by authorities in Zimbabwe to revamp the nation’s financial sector, which has seen massive hyperinflation since 2007.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe’s government is also partnering with Apollo Fintech to develop a gold-backed cryptocurrency for the country. The collaboration is expected to allow Zimbabweans to have access to the Apollo wallet for digital-currency payments.Despite the government’s 2018 crypto ban, peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies continues to thrive in Zimbabwe, as the country’s faltering monetary policies seemingly push investors toward digital currencies. In mid-2019, cryptomania in Zimbabwe reached such a fever pitch that false rumors about the price of Bitcoin (BTC) reaching a 600% premium began to spread.The RBZ’s plan to create a regulatory testing environment for local crypto companies also comes at a time when the government is reportedly exploring plans for a central bank digital currency.RBZ proposes regulatory sandbox for crypto businessesAs previouslyreported by Cointelegraph, the RBZ has reportedly proposed a regulatory sandbox for local crypto businesses. Cointelegraph has since confirmed that Josephat Mutepfa, the RBZ’s deputy director for financial markets and national payment systems, revealed the plan in a speech delivered at the Sound Prosperity Economic Forum in Bulawayo on March 13. An excerpt from Mutepfa’s address reads:“We have already started to come up with a fintech framework because in regulation everything should be well-structured. The framework, which is a regulatory sandbox, will be assessing cryptocurrency companies as to how they are going to operate. The sandbox will be an experimenting zone. Once the sandbox is there, there will be an application criterion, which will also act in the same capacity as the sandbox.”According to Mutepfa, Zimbabwe’s central bank is keen on creating a robust vetting framework to ensure that participating crypto businesses model their operations to suit existing financial regulations in the country. As part of its initial plans for the crypto-regulatory sandbox, the RBZ is reportedly focusing on companies dealing in cryptocurrency-related trading and remittance.For Mutepfa, the proposed sandbox signals a pivot by the RBZ and the Zimbabwean government regarding its stance on the emerging digital economy, following a 2018 ban on financial institutions participating in crypto transactions.Related: Countries That First Outlawed Crypto but Then Embraced ItGiven the popularity of digital assets among the country’s younger demographic, Mutepfa opined that it was incumbent on the RBZ and the country’s government to work out methods for regulating the industry rather than focusing on prohibition. By ensuring greater government involvement in the digital sphere, he argued that issues such as access to capital can be mitigated, thus allowing small- and medium-scale cryptocurrency businesses to blossom in Zimbabwe.Commenting on the RBZ’s plans to create the regulatory sandbox, Marius Reitz, the general manager of Africa for the Luno crypto-exchange platform, hailed the decision as a positive one for Zimbabwe’s digital-currency space. In an email to Cointelegraph, Reitz declared:“The new sandbox is excellent news. It will be critical for bringing more clarity and protection, which will only help crypto’s transition into mainstream use. Some people believe that regulation will stifle adoption but we believe it can play a major role in boosting trust in our sector, which we know is a huge barrier for adoption.”According to Reitz, the creation of the regulatory sandbox will open the way for constructive dialogue among crypto businesses and regulators, stating, “It’s important that there’s a strong relationship between these two stakeholders so crypto firms know what regulation to expect and how they can best protect their customers.”Crypto legalization amid ongoing currency-stabilization driveAccording to Mthabisi Tshuma, a business correspondent at the Zimbabwean daily The Chronicle, the government appears keen on legitimizing the crypto industry as part of its drive to improve the country’s financial sector. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Tshuma remarked:“The cryptocurrency market in the country is under review and if all goes well the government will adopt it into the financial sector as stated in last year’s monetary policy.”In its monetary policy statement from February, the RBZ revealed that its focus was on stabilizing its currency. Having suffered massive hyperinflation since 2007, the bank appears intent on eradicating the volatility of its exchange rate through the establishment of a currency-stabilization task force. According to the RBZ, exchange-rate stabilization will result in a corresponding decrease in inflation, thus leading to significant economic recovery for the country.As part of the currency-stabilization efforts being spearheaded by the country’s finance minister, the RBZ plans to set up a Reuters-based platform for electronic foreign exchanges that will allow free forex deals among participating banks. Authorized currency-exchange agents will also be allowed on the platform via authorized dealers.While there is no official word from the government, a crypto regulatory sandbox established by the RBZ could be a precursor to the legalization of cryptocurrencies in the country. For now, crypto remains largely unregulated in sub-Saharan Africa, where the two Southern African nations of Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be on a trajectory toward cryptocurrency legalization. For Zimbabwe, the goal might be tied toward leveraging its digital economy as a means of alleviating economic issues, while for South Africa the emergence of clear-cut laws might help to combat the many instances of virtual-currency scams in the country.So far, however, there have been reports of commercial banks in South Africa closing accounts belonging to crypto exchanges, citing the absence of regulatory clarity for the country’s cryptocurrency industry. Asreported by Cointelegraph in December 2019, the South African Reserve Bank is considering the introduction of new cryptocurrency regulations. These laws reportedly focus on rules that will prevent the use of digital currencies for money laundering and tax evasion.According to Reitz, the South African Reserve Bank is in consultation with industry stakeholders to craft a meaningful regulatory framework for South Africa’s crypto space. As part of his email to Cointelegraph, the general manager of Africa for Luno revealed:“The SA Reserve Bank has established a working group (including players from the industry) to craft a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, so it could be explored in the future. With South Africa ranking as the third-highest country with Google searches for bitcoin, crypto is definitely a growing industry in South Africa and we’re sure the authorities are keeping a close eye on developments.”Gold-backed digital currency in partnership with Apollo FintechZimbabwe’s government is also reportedly partnering with Apollo Fintech to launch a gold-backed digital currency for its citizens. On Friday, Apolloannounced that it has signed a memorandum of agreement with CBZ Bank — one of the country’s largest commercial banks — to develop three national fintech projects. The proposed gold-backed digital currency is one of the three projects currently being developed by Apollo for CBZ with the backing of the Zimbabwean government.Given the less-than-stellar record of Zimbabwe’s government on matters relating to its national currency, crypto adoption might present a viable solution. However, asset-backed digital currencies have yet to show any evidence of success.Venezuela’s oil-backed Petro has so far failed to make any significant progress despite concerted efforts by the country’s government to enforce the adoption of the digital currency. Like Zimbabwe, Venezuela is also suffering from massive hyperinflation, a situation further worsened by economic sanctions imposed on President Nicolás Maduro’s administration by the United States government.Related: Venezuela President Maduro Is Not Pro-Crypto, He Just Likes PetroApollo Fintech CEO Stephen McCullah said he was excited to work with the Zimbabwean government. In a tweet published by the company on Thursday, Apollo identified Zimbabwe as a “priority country” for the live implementation of its suite of national crypto and financial solutions.If the other yet-to-be-announced projects include an interbank settlement network, then Zimbabwe will be joining the likes of Iran in utilizing fintech to revamp its ailing financial sector."

Broekhoven also noted that the blockchain startup’s connections and backing from the legacy financial industry was a major factor in Citi’s decision to partner with Komgo. He stated:""This way we help to ensure that the features that Komgo develops really address the pain points of a wide variety of users—beyond banks—and the platform has a number of institutions behind it that commit to transacting on the platform.""Citi begins Komgo integrationIn addition to increasing its equity stake in Komgo, Citi has begun integrating its trade engine with the startup’s blockchain. “Komgo helps to speed up turnaround times, improve data reconciliation, and reduce the risk of fraud and human error,” Broekhoven stated.In the past, the startup has secured backing from a number of leading financial institutions, including ING Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and Societe Generale."
41683, Bitcoin Was Designed for a Financial Crisis — So far it’s Working Well ,2020-03-21t22:17:00+00:00,47068,656,"If you’ve been in Bitcoin (BTC) long enough most likely its Genesis Block has been mentioned quite a few times. If not, the image below should be self explanatory.Bitcoin Genesis Block RAW data. Source: UnBIt doesn’t really matter if people consider Bitcoin as a store of value competing with gold and real estate, a medium of exchange for uncensored transactions, or a potential unit of account due to its non-inflationary model. As the digital currency supporters say, “honeybadger doesn’t care” and they’re right in that sense. Most likely there will never be a consensus on what Bitcoin’s main usage is and some would argue that there is no need for one.Bitcoin was designed to work on a standalone basis, without the need of banks, governments, international currencies or whatever system is needed for traditional fiat money. Satellite and mesh network communication systems are currently in use in order to keep the Bitcoin blockchain alive even during an internet outage. One does not need to imagine a catastrophic scenario in order to put Bitcoin usage to the test as people from North Korea and Iran are already using it to bypass international sanctions.How is Bitcoin a store-of-value after last week’s 45% drop?There are many who argue that Bitcoin cannot be a store-of-value based on its whipsaw volatility but valuable insight can be drawn from gold’s price action during the 2008 financial crisis.Gold/USD daily chart 2007 - 2009. Source: TradingViewGold certainly doesn’t look like a safe haven after a 24% plunge in less than 2 months, even more worrisome is the fact that the S&P 500 remained flat during that period. Therefore, is it really fair to analyze any correlation over such a short period? Does that sharp movement in price invalidate gold’s resilience during market uncertainties?The same thing can be said as Bitcoin enters its first-ever major global crisis. This, in fact, is the first of four triggers for a major price pump ahead; this is where we will focus.Resilience and lack of correlationBitcoin price sustaining a level above $5,000 translates into a 55% or more premium to the December 2018 low of $3,200. Keep in mind the current crisis is something without precedent over the past decades.The S&P 500 took only 3 weeks to drop 20% from its peak, a point which most investors consider the beginning of a bear market. This is unprecedented in history even compared to the 1929 stock market crash.Bitcoin and S&P 500 60-day correlation chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin’s lack of correlation with stock markets is another factor that might aid a new wave of inflow as investors realize the crisis has impacted almost every asset class imaginable. The chart above represents the price relation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin on a scale from -1, a perfect inverse relation to +1, a perfect relation. The indicator clearly trends to 0 most of the time indicating there is absolutely no relationship between the two assets.2020 Bitcoin halvingThe equivalent inflation being reduced to 1.8% per year after the block subsidy cut does not directly translate into price appreciation. What investors should be looking for is the sustainability of the network despite the halving’s negative impact on every single miner. It is a $5 billion industry and yet there’s nothing they can do in order to prevent it.The mere existence of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Cash SV (BSV) is a reminder that social consensus determines Bitcoin (BTC) rules, not miners, not exchanges, and certainly not the CME.Those forks were willing to increase block capacity, hence increasing the difficulty for an average user to run a node. The simple fact of the network continuous operation and adherence to the social consensus will be itself a display of strength.Will Bitcoin survive the current financial crisis?Even though the current crisis does not seem to be mortgage credit-related, the economic turmoil caused by the Coronavirus might be enough to bring down highly leveraged companies, physical retail oriented businesses and credit lenders. This GDP setback could be the trigger needed to remove confidence in the financial system as a whole.No one expects Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be the first option for most investors but it surely is a contender for a small percentage, as evidenced by a Charles Schwab report published in November 2019. Recent examples of Venezuela, Turkey and Iran struggling to deal with hyperinflation of their local currencies shows that the financial crisis could lead to a perfect runaway for increased Bitcoin adoption.Looking forwardSince its inception Bitcoin has been patiently waiting for a global crisis. The recent price crash does not reflect investors' lack of confidence in Bitcoin's network strength, digital scarcity or its ability to work as a medium of exchange.The potential triggers for an upcoming rally comenot only from its decentralized and noninflationary naturebut also from the potential crisis impact on financial institutions and the government’s ability to sustain fiat money credibility.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

41682, OKEx’s Lennix Lai: Passive Income in Crypto Is the New Way to Earn ,2020-03-22t06:00:00+00:00,28444,201,"First, there were property rents. Then came interests. As modern civilization evolves, people always find new ways to earn money without actually producing, or even doing all that much. This concept is today known as “passive income.” Technological progress also expanded the meaning of passive income.Today, people can claim YouTube advertisement revenues, dropshipping and even creating online courses as their favorite way to earn passive income. Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets at OKEx, believes there is another method to add to this ever-expansive list: crypto staking. He was a keynote speaker during the Blockchain Economy 2020 conference in Turkey, where he explained why crypto is an ideal way to earn passive income. He also told Cointelegraph what would be the benefits of a more matured blockchain-based financial system.Cointelegraph: What do you believe is the next logical step for blockchain and crypto?Lennix Lai: The rising number of cryptocurrency wallet users creates an entirely new ecosystem. First, there are going to be regulators and central banks. People enter this new ecosystem by storing their digital asset wallets on their mobile phone or their computer first.Then the ecosystem will start to build decentralized applications, DeFi projects or stablecoins. Right now, we have about 35 million cryptocurrency users. But after central bank-issued stablecoins, we will talk about billions of users.We are stepping into the next generation. The next generation is happening right now with national bank-issued stablecoins, I believe. I would say it will grow the cryptocurrency user base like 10 times or more.CT: It looks like the next generation of blockchain is ""blockchain for everyone,"" not just companies or exchanges?LL: Bitcoin is the first use case leveraging the blockchain concept. Without Bitcoin, blockchain is simply a decentralized database. It's just a database language. We just want to store information in a decentralized manner. But adding the element of cryptography to this decentralized database has resulted in the creation of Bitcoin. [...] But still, it was a very ""geeky"" project, really concentrated on heavy believers and visionaries.For the next generation of blockchain, we need to maintain the beauty of blockchain first, immutable, scalable, open to everyone, super low entry-level in terms of transaction costs, super high efficiency. Then, we need to tackle the technical difficulties of blockchain in terms of security, scalability and decentralization.At the same time, we need to take governments and regulators into consideration as well. They should have a superior monitoring authority that can see the transactions within the blockchain. That's why we expect governments and regulators to be a part of this decentralized ecosystem we're building with OKChain.CT: How do you utilize crypto for a passive income concept?LL: The combination of cryptocurrency and DeFi creates an alternative way for users to earn passive interest that was not possible before. Because traditionally, you may need to deposit to the bank or reserve a depository for saving interest. You can buy bonds, and you can lend to somebody with some interest. But that's a limited way, and it involves many evaluation criteria. Sometimes, it's challenging to secure a loan, especially for small and medium enterprises.Crypto, first of all, introduces a permissionless way for passive interest. Everyone can securely borrow and lend within the protocol according to the design of a smart contract. You can have borrowing and lending without the bank sitting in between.This substantially drives down the barrier of entry, especially the unbanked population of the world, who doesn't have access to the traditional banking system. Right now, we have around at least one-fifth or one-sixth of the global population without any banking support. They can't open a bank account at all for various reasons.But right now, we are talking about a protocol that can serve even rural populations around the globe, without a bank. That is very exciting because we can now create a vision that says your mobile phone will be your bank. Without any bank accounts. You can do anything that usually a bank enables you to do via your mobile phone with a cryptocurrency wallet. You can pay, receive money, earn interest and make an investment — all executed in a decentralized manner.CT: Do you think passive income by staking crypto will be a popular way to earn in the future?LL: Staking is a unique passive income profile that could never be available in the traditional banking market. There's no staking product in banking and finance. Because what staking does is, basically: You deposit your token in a certain protocol. That token will then help to secure the stability of the whole network.By staking, you become part of shareholders/validators/protectors of the network. You are a part of the network itself.The interest rate return right now is much higher than traditional banking. So, it could be a very hot topic. Because one of the great benefits of adopting crypto is, aside from simple transfer and protecting assets, to earn passive interest.CT: Do you have any other plans for making crypto available to a much bigger audience?LL: We have to make crypto simple first. Right now, all the tech you hear like blockchain, smart contracts or private keys are still super complicated. Most of the blockchain industry consists of high-end developers. And traders' world needs very complex derivatives which we provide at OKEx.But when you talk about mass audiences, we have to make it very simple. We don't talk about private keys or any other tricky concept. We aim to launch a new product that any ordinary user can sign up, buy a cryptocurrency with their local currency, and earn passive interest by staking coins.CT: The more blockchain-based finance evolves, the more it resembles the traditional finance industry we all love to hate. How will the ""blockchain economy"" differentiate itself from the current centralized finance system?LL: That's a great question. Can we put everything on the blockchain that's in the centralized system right now? I don't think so. First, the centralized system right now is working quite well. It is slow sometimes, it might not be very efficient. But the size is so big, with volumes of trillions of dollars. It's a robust financial system right now.Also, because of the increased regulations, the traditional market is getting a lot more efficient than before. A lot of regulation that we talk about is related to checking, to disclosure. For example, the bank needs to disclose their balance sheets, and the security firm needs to disclose the access of the client, the fund manager needs to disclose the buy and sell orders, and so on.If you think about the blockchain concept, you don't need a regulator to play this role because everything can be executed on a technological basis. It's immutable. It's transparent. Everyone can see it, along with regulators. Each move and transaction is logged on-chain. In summary, we can serve the exact same regulatory purpose with a fraction of the costs that the regulators are spending right now.So, with blockchain technology, the cost of maintaining a healthy financial system would be much smaller while serving the same goal and purpose. That's why I believe the traditional finance world will eventually adopt blockchain technology to reduce costs and increase efficiency, especially in terms of regulatory processes and cross-border transactions.The interview has been shortened and edited for clarity."
41681, Zcash Reward-Distribution Vote Questioned as Only a Small Sample Took Part ,2020-03-22t04:00:00+00:00,3283,95,"At the end of January, a poll apparently confirmed community support for a new mining reward-distribution structure for the Zcash (ZEC) network, whereby more will flow into the developer fund. Still, the decision proved to be rather controversial.Electric Coin Company, the firm behind Zcash, announced in a Jan. 2 blog post that a community poll on the Zcash Improvement Proposal 1014 — referred to as ZIP 1014 — showed a consensus for implementing a 20% fee on mining rewards. The results showed that 77 people, or 87.5% of all votes, were in favor of the implementation, while just 11 people, or 12.5% of all votes, stood against it. But some in the cryptocurrency space have expressed concern that the poll may not accurately represent the stance of the community.Still, data published by the Zcash Foundation revealed that 71 members of the Zcash community forum also voted in a separate poll, where a less-overwhelming majority showed support for fees on ZEC mining, as well. The foundation also set up miner signaling, but no votes were collected that way.A Zcash community manager and mining software programmer, who goes by the name of Fireice, told Cointelegraph that he believes the results indeed represent what the majority of the community wants, adding that he “would have been pretty surprised if Zcash holders voted to defund the future of their own assets.” He concluded:“I think Zcash Foundation took great care to be as inclusive as possible. My main problem as to effectiveness would be how long it took, markets hate uncertainty. [...] I think the whole process could have been smoother, especially given that it could have been planned well in advance.”Lior Yaffe, a computer scientist and founder of the blockchain firm Jelurida, told Cointelegraph he got the impression that the involved organizations “invested a lot of thinking in the design of the community poll.” Still, he added that, as a consequence, the system is rather complicated:“The result is so technical and detailed that I suspect that it was too technical for most miners/community members to comprehend the consequences of their voting.”Yaffe said he believes that a reliable source of funding is essential for blockchains to succeed but that a simple pool of four choices with different percentages would have been sufficient. Still, he admitted that he is “not an expert in how the ZCash community makes its decisions, and the culture which has already developed around it.”Yaffe also criticized that miners were given a say, describing them as opportunistic and focused on “their own short-term profits rather [than] on the long-term success of the project.” Overall, he proposed proof-of-stake voting as a better alternative to the system used by Zcash:“One advantage of PoS coins is that there is a straight forward voting mechanism: voting by stake, where each token represents one vote. This also nicely aligns with the block generators incentives which may or may not decide to participate. PoW coins like ZCash do not have this luxury.”A continuation of the Zcash founders rewardSince its launch in 2016, the Zcash protocol has been programmed to let miners have 80% of the coins created in every new block, while 20% has been distributed as follows: 7% for the Electric Coin Company, 5% for the Zcash Foundation and 8% for grants. This fee on mining was only meant to last until November 2020, but the poll apparently showed consensus for establishing a new fee going forward.Apparently, only members of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel were authorized to vote in the poll, and the panel in question is managed by the Zcash Foundation. However, the organization’s communications manager, Sonya Mann, told Cointelegraph that applications for joining the poll were open to the larger community, and only two people were rejected.When asked whether the results of such polls are enforced as mandatory, Mann claimed that “miners ultimately ‘ratify’ any governance decisions on-chain, by choosing to run the software that enforces a given set of consensus rules.” She concluded, “Dissent can be expressed by forking. So no, it's not mandatory.”When asked by Cointelegraph whether the Zcash trademark rule prevents miners from being able to influence the network, Fireice pointed out that he does not think “miners are the only part that has a stake in discussions.” He also pointed out that miners still have major influence over Zcash:“Miners can (and did, see Ycash) vote with their feet too. I'm mostly happy that ZF has part ownership of Zcash TM, beforehand it was in precarious position of not owning assets it was set up to manage.”The Zcash trademark and the complicated nature of community consensusStill, Zcash is a registered trademark jointly held by Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation, a fact that could limit the ability of the community to use a hard fork to avoid a network update that they do not agree with. When asked whether a fork is a solution, given that — even if approved by most of the community — it cannot be called Zcash, the executive director of the Zcash Foundation, Josh Cincinnati, told Cointelegraph in an email that “the trademark agreement ultimately relies on community consensus.”The document that Cincinnati was referring to is the agreement regulating how the trademark is managed by the involved organizations. Section 19.12 apparently gives the community the ultimate say in what can or cannot be called Zcash:“Each party covenants and agrees that it will not make or withhold any approval, consents, or other decision under this Agreement if such approval, consent, or other decision is contrary to the Clear Consensus of the Zcash community.”Still, the document simply states that the Zcash Foundation and ECC can agree upon the evidence that determines if there is a clear consensus, without describing how community preference can be measured. Cincinnati explained why such an abstract rule is preferred, rather than simply applying the Zcash name to the fork with the higher hash rate:“The abstract rule is preferable because both non-subjective rules you mention can be trivially gamed; consider that at one point in 2017 Bitcoin Cash had ‘more’ hash rate but clearly (at least in our view) less grassroot support to plain old Bitcoin.”Yaffe, on the other hand, said that he believes the abstract rule is preferable to leaving the decision to miners. He said:“I think it was intentionally designed this way since as explained by the ZCash representative leaving the decision to PoW miners is even worse from the reason I explained above.”Finally, Yaffe pointed out that he is convinced that for a blockchain “with deep technology such as ZCash, a fork not supported by the developers, even if backed temporarily by higher hash rate will not survive for long.” He explained that, in such an instance, he expects the technology advances would at some point render the unsupported fork obsolete, and miners would move back to the supported network."

He said:“A domestically issued digital currency backed by a trusted government, denominated in the domestic unit of account, may help limit the adoption of privately issued currencies (e.g. stablecoins), which may be difficult to regulate and could pose risks to financial stability and monetary policy transmission.”The IMF official mentioned the negative side of a CBDC as wellZhang stressed the importance of a proposed-CBDC’s structure in limiting potential risks.The director said such an asset could steer customers away from banks, as well as strain central bank balance sheets.Zhang also included that the central bank could incur risks and expenses from the endeavor. “Offering CBDC could be very costly for central banks, and it could pose risks to their reputations,” he said, adding:“Offering full-fledged CBDC requires central banks to be active along several steps of the payments value chain, potentially including interfacing with customers, building front-end wallets, picking and maintaining technology, monitoring transactions, and being responsible for AML/CFT issues.”Zhang added that hacks and other faults could impede such operations, leading to a black mark on the bank’s trustworthiness.The official mentioned a potential hybrid solution called a synthetic CBDC, or sCBDC. Such an asset would involve collaboration between the central bank and the private sector. “The private sector would issue coins fully backed with central bank reserves, under the supervision of the central bank,” he explained.CBDCs have been a hot topic for a while now. Sweden started testing a CBDC in February, and several other central banks have discussed the prospect, although not everyone is interested in CBDCs.Cointelegraph reached out to the IMF for additional details, but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in."

The Foundation continues to believe the lawsuits were meritless and continues to deny any wrongdoing.”By settling, Tezos avoids the risk of having a court rule that its ICO was a securities offering.Tezos Foundation holds $635 millionSince conducting its record-breaking ICO, Tezos’ assets have nearly tripled in value — with the foundation’s March 9 biannual report revealing that it holds $635 million in assets.The report also revealed that the foundation has deployed $37.6 million in grant funding for the Tezos (XTZ) network since August 2019."

Loeffler was formerly the CEO of the digital asset custody service, Bakkt, and is the most-recent appointee to the United States Senate.Appearing on Fox News on March 21, Loeffler again sought to distance herself from the decision-making process surrounding her trades, stating:“I’m not involved in the decision around buying and selling, there is a range of different decisions made every day with regard to my savings and 401K portfolios that I am not involved in.”She added: “If you actually look at the personal transaction reports that were filed, it notices at the bottom that I am only informed of my transactions after they occur, several weeks.”Loeffler’s portfolio is managed by a third partyAppearing on the Tucker Carlson Show, also on March 21, she explained that a third party person or set of advisors is tasked with making decisions regarding her portfolio — a system she has maintained since working in the financial services industry.“I think the most important thing is that I am informed only after those trades are made, I have nothing in terms of say in what buys and sells are executed, what that timing is, and I'm only advised after it happens — almost concurrent with the public reporting that we do here.”Her third party investment managers appear to be very skilled, as they successfully offloaded over $1 million in stocks on Jan. 24 — narrowly avoiding the recent record slump.Loeffler purchase shares in a company well-positioned for coronavirus pandemicIn addition to 27 sell orders, Loeffler also made two investments of between $100,000 and $250,000 into the teleconferencing firm, Citrix.When asked about her portfolio managers' decision to make purchases in a company well-positioned to benefit from the coronavirus pandemic, Loeffler told Fox News: “like any other trade, you can’t see into the future.”Overall, she described the trades as “very routine.”Senator faces backlash for allegedly deceiving publicMuch of the backlash against Loeffler has stemmed from her portraying the U.S. economy as “prepared” for the impacts of COVID-19 after she had been informed of the trade on Feb. 16.Despite being aware that her portfolio managers had dumped her shares on mass alongside purchases into a company providing services for distributing workplaces, Loeffler tweeted on March 10:“Concerned about #coronavirus?

All other Twitter users encounter a message stating that tweets posted by these accounts are “unavailable.”On March 21, Twitter announced that it is “working with global public health authorities to identify experts” on the subject of COVID-19 as part of an initiative to restrict the dissemination of coronavirus-related information by uncredentialed sources.Crypto community rushed to Selkis’ defenseThe crypto community has pushed back against Selkis’ shadow-banning, promoting his request for assistance in getting the ban lifted and vouching for his journalistic contributions to cryptocurrency.During February 2014, Selkis broke the story that the then-leading crypto exchange, Mt. Gox, had been hacked. The exchange’s loss of nearly 750,000 Bitcoins (BTC) was one of the first major scandals in the blockchain space. The event ultimately led to the downfall of the exchange, and triggered a multi-year bear market for the industry.

41673, Flight to Quality: Investors Seek Shelter in US Dollars & Bitcoin ,2020-03-21t21:00:00+00:00,6703,165,"Two of the best-performing currencies since the March 12 meltdown have been the United States Dollar and Bitcoin. In times of economic turmoil, investors shed riskier assets and acquire less volatile ones. This is known as “flight to quality.” This happened in 2008 when the global demand for U.S. government bonds resulted in negative interest rates, and may be happening now with Bitcoin.Bitcoin closed at $4,970.79 on March 12. However, on March 19, it rebounded 25% to $6,191.19.Meanwhile, the USD has been gaining on its main competitors for global dominance: Euro, GBP, AUD, and CAD, amongst others.Source: OandaGoogle Trends: coronavirus, USD & BTC go hand-in-handGoogle Trends indicates that the coronavirus has caused a simultaneous spike in searches for “Bitcoin” and the “United States dollar.”Source: Cointelegraph, Google TrendsThere is a strong correlation between the searches for “Coronavirus,” “Bitcoin” and “United States Dollar.”When the U.S. population began fixating on the virus in early March, it was followed by an increased interest in these two “quality” currencies. On the other hand, the interest in “Euro” and “FX Rates” are negatively correlated with “coronavirus.” This could indicate that the public perceives two very different currencies as a hedge against potential economic collapse.Source: Cointelegraph, Google TrendsBTC is a hedge against the old economyAs uncertainty about the old economic order deepens, even more people will start looking for an alternative, or hedge. It needs to be an asset that is as disconnected as possible from the rest of the economy. This used to be the gold, but without a solid banking system in place, there will be no gold as an asset class.The same sentiment was expressed by Philip Salter, the head of operations at Genesis Mining, in a recent Cointelegraph interview:“If this economic crisis is contained, then it will not have major implications for Bitcoin. However, if there is a real collapse, then the interest in Bitcoin will explode. It will go back to being seen as a hedge against the banking system. The more skepticism people will have in the old economy, the more they will flock to Bitcoin.”Salter believes that an economic meltdown would fulfill the prophecy of Bitcoin becoming a new digital form of gold."

Or perhaps more importantly, who? And why does it matter?Lead Digital Strategist at Fundstrat David Grider and Platinum Account Manager at eToro Simon Peters break down Bitcoin’s next move, how the coronavirus and financial crisis may impact the halving, and how Bitcoin’s fundamentals will affect its long-term prospects.Who Is Behind Bitcoin Price Movements?Bitcoin has experienced an incredible amount of volatility over the past two weeks amidst the coronavirus pandemic and global financial crises. A Chainalysis report found professional traders and investors were usually the drivers behind recent major price movements, despite only moving about 5% of the total supply of Bitcoin.David took issue with the vague label of “professional trader/investor”. He reminded us that traditional or institutional players are not the only ones who can drive the market with high volume trades:“I think that probably you’ve seen an onboarding in 2016/2017 of a traditional, probably institutional, fund class to some degree but not very large, right. But still prior to that this was a very small market and I think that it’s still probably mostly dominated by early larger crypto whales, right.”How Will the Coronavirus Crisis Strengthen Bitcoin?Since the beginning of March Bitcoin has been heavily correlated with large movements in the stock market. When asked if the Bitcoin price drops in the past two weeks were the result of professional players liquidating their positions, Simon nodded his head in agreement.He went on to explain how this shedding of weak hands could allow Bitcoin to eventually evolve into a hedge asset:“We’ve seen this conversion of assets into cash, regardless of which market it is, but there will come a point where, due to this increasing amount that’s been pumped into the system, the cash is going to lose its value. Then as the virus no doubt stems down and the number of new cases that are being reported tails off, the question to investors then is, ‘what do I do with all this cash that I have?’ And then they may look into other assets that can hedge against that, essentially, with crypto possibly being one of them.”If you enjoyed this latest crypto market update, hit the Like button and subscribe to our YouTube channel for more weekly crypto content!"

NetCents announced March 20 that it had begun edge-case scenario testing in real-world environments in order to ready the card for launch.Not like other crypto credit cardsThe NetCents credit card promises users will not have to pre-load cryptocurrency onto their cards, differing from otherwise-similar products already on the market. Cards which require pre-loading can sometimes rob users of crypto value appreciation they would have otherwise received in the interim between loading and spending their coins.The NetCents card is directly tied to each user’s wallet, which allows cryptocurrency to be spent in real-time. The company has adapted its instant settlement technology to allow merchants to convert funds into fiat at time-of-purchase. They have also integrated the NetCents exchange into their offering.With integration of the card into its existing ecosystem complete, testing in real-world environments has begun. This is the final stage of development before public launch.Cointelegraph has reached out to NetCents for information on their testing and launch schedule, but had not received a response at time of publishing.The NetCents credit card will be issued on the Visa network. It will have a chip, pin, magstripe, and near-field communication technology. Usage will be integrated into the NetCents mobile application.Users will also be able to choose up to three spendable cryptocurrencies through the card. Initially supported cryptocurrencies will be Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).More competition from crypto bankingWhile the NetCents card may distinguish itself among other credit cards, it also faces competition from the crypto-banking sector.As Cointelegraph previously reported, German startup, Bitwala, offers a mobile cryptocurrency banking app with accompanying payment card as well. It should be noted, however, that the Bitcoin and Ether held there must be converted to fiat before spending.Meanwhile United Kingdom-based Ziglu will allow users to hold multiple fiat and cryptocurrencies, choosing and converting what they spend in real-time at point of sale.The NetCents card will initially be available to Canadian Residents."

Trader Peter Brandt isn’t optimistic. He sees Bitcoin in a race with gold to hit $1,000. Then again, in January, he thought BTC wouldn’t reach $6,000. And there has been something of a rebound. After diving to $3,700, Bitcoin did climb back, along with stocks, in response to the government’s coronavirus response package. Tim Draper believes that when the dust settles (and no one coughs), it will be blockchain that builds the new world—not banks and governments. In the meantime, of course, the Federal Reserve will do what the Federal Reserve does. It’s slashed interest rates to zero and is restarting Quantitative Easing. It’s printing money—something you just can’t do with a blockchain.And the government is giving money away. The Trump administration has said that it is going to send out checks for $1,000 to U.S. citizens. What would happen if everyone uses that money to load up on Bitcoin? Some people have been crunching the numbers. They think it would send the price of BTC back past $20,000. Which would be nice, but it ain’t gonna happen like that.Congressman Darren Soto, the co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, has been talking about getting the blockchain into the federal budget, the status of Libra, and why President Trump hates Bitcoin so much.US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, might be coming around though. Though he’s long been a crypto skeptic, Mnuchin just appointed Brian Brooks as one of the country’s top banking regulators. Brooks, who will be Chief Operating Officer and First Deputy Comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, was the chief legal officer at Coinbase. During his tenure with the company, Brooks called for a tokenized version of the dollar.A dollar token would free up financial transactions, but the blockchain can do so much more. Chinese journalist, Sarah Zheng of the South China Morning Post, has used a blockchain to bypass Chinese government censorship. Her interview with Dr. Ai, a medical doctor from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, contained QR codes and used the Ethereum network to store content online.But any tool can be used for evil as well as good.

The commission argued that the company’s ICO comprised a clear issuance of securities. While Kik has sought to claim that KIN comprises a currency and not a security, the SEC claims to have “undisputed evidence” to the contrary. The SEC states that:“Kik’s 2017 offer and sale of Kin was an offer and sale of investment contracts to the public, which was not registered with the SEC, and for which there was no exemption from registration under the act.”Kik sold over half a trillion tokens to investors outside of Canada and raised $100 million via its ICO during September 2017.Kik accused of distributing unlicensed securitiesThe commission alleges that Kik blatantly informed investors that KIN prices would increase alongside growing demand for the tokens — comprising a naked violation of the Securities Act through cultivating an expectation for profit among investors.The SEC also noted that the company assured would-be contributors that it would “undertake crucial work to spur that demand.”SEC seeks permanent injunction against KikThe SEC asserted that the structure of Kik’s offering “deprived thousands of investors the protections and required disclosures under the federal securities laws.”The commission is seeking a permanent injunction against the Canadian company, in addition to penalties, disgorgement of Kiks “ill-gotten gains,” in addition to interest.The regulator argued that Kik’s “pivot” into digital token issuance was motivated by years of losses incurred from its free messaging service.Lawsuit exacerbates Kik's financial difficultiesThe lawsuit has further compounded Kik’s economic woes, with the company announcing it would shut down its free messaging service during September last year.The messaging platform was bought by U.S.-based firm MediaLab the following month."

BTC price rebounded from $3,800 towards $6,940, a rally of 81%.BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart is showing precise levels of resistance and support. The $5,600 area broke to the upside, which indicated continuation to the upside, leading the price to a high of $6,940.The resistance area is quite clear and found between $6,400-6,900. Unfortunately, the price of Bitcoin couldn’t break through this resistance, which was required to flip the trend bullish.At this point, the rejection looks to be a bearish retest of the previous support zone. A bearish retest means that the previous support is confirmed resistance and usually leads to further downwards momentum.BTC USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe 1-day chart shows a clear picture, through which the bearish retest is seen. To become bullish, a breakthrough in the red resistance area is profoundly needed. Once the price of Bitcoin breaks through this zone and additionally reclaims the level as support, then the bullish momentum can return to the market.However, at this point, the market looks to make a bearish retest after an 80% surge since the low at $3,800. The $5,600 support level is essential. If Bitcoin can hold this area as support, a possible new resistance test can occur.The more the resistance zone gets tested, the weaker it becomes and vice versa. But, the trend is still down, and therefore, investors should keep in mind that lower levels are more likely to be tested for support.Total market cap facing clear resistance at $185 billionTotal market capitalization crypto 1-day chart.

It showed a clear downtrend through 2018 with lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bear market, while Bitcoin kept resting on the $6,000 support.Currently, the chart is providing a similar situation here. The total market capitalization dropped below the $185 billion levels and dropped towards the next support zone (green areas) at $108-110 billion.Given that the market has seen such a big drop, it’s not unnatural to see a strong relief bounce after. However, this was met with an instant rejection at $185 billion, which is now confirmed resistance.A bullish perspective would be the breakthrough of this resistance area, after which a confirmation of support would suggest further momentum upwards towards $240 billion.Unfortunately, with this latest rejection, it seems more likely to have tests downwards for support before any upwards momentum is warranted.The bullish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD 4-hour bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewAt first, the price of Bitcoin is currently hovering in between ranges, which makes it more difficult to give a clear cut view of the markets. However, the bullish scenario is straightforward.The price of Bitcoin needs to hold the $5,600 level for support, as that’s a key point for the market. As long as that support holds, upwards tests of the $6,500-6,900 areas are likely to occur.The next step for bullish momentum would be the flip of the $6,500 area for support. Once that happens, a continuation of $7,500 is the next thing to look for.The bearish scenario for BitcoinBTC USD 4-hour bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario is still the likely scenario of the two. The rejection at $6,800 doesn’t show any strength, as any bullish momentum is only warranted through a breakthrough in that area.Given that the price didn’t, I assume the market will make a lower high at $6,400-6,600 area, after which further downwards momentum is warranted. The $5,500-5,600 area is a crucial point, as discussed previously. Once the price of Bitcoin breaks below this level, a severe drop is likely to occur.Is that a bad thing for the market? No, low prices will give investors tremendous opportunities to buy the assets relatively cheap again. Gold and silver have seen big shocks throughout the week as well.What are the levels to look for in case of a breakdown? There are three zones to watch for potential support, which are the $4,700-4,800 area, the $4,200 level and the $3,750 level.The last two would provide a potential bullish divergence on the daily timeframe, which would make a strong signal for a bottom. An example is found in the bottom structure in December 2018.All in all, it seems unlikely to have a bottom already, and further accumulation should be expected for the market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

41659, Stuck in Quarantine? Become a Blockchain Expert With These Online Courses ,2020-03-21t13:35:00+00:00,50150,357,"It seems like the entire world has been told to stay inside their homes as the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc. As a result, the world has become almost entirely digital.A recent article from NPR showed that visits to news sites have increased by 60%, and that people are spending more time playing online video games. At the same time, online teaching platforms have started offering free, or heavily discounted, virtual courses. Below are a list of online blockchain and cryptocurrency courses worth exploring while spending time at home.Coursera: “Blockchain Revolution Specialization”Ranked by e-learning hub Digital Defynd as the best blockchain-certification course, Coursera’s “Blockchain Revolution” course series is designed to introduce learners to blockchain for business, government and society.The courses are taught by Don Tapscott, a globally recognized speaker and the executive director of the Blockchain Research Institute, and Alex Tapscott, the author of the best-selling book “Blockchain Revolution” and a new book called “Financial Services Revolution.”The BRI’s director of communications, Luke Bradley, told Cointelegraph that students from all different backgrounds have found the Blockchain Revolution course series valuable:“There’s no coding experience required to take the course. All you need is about 8–12 hours a week, and we’ve had some learners finish the course by putting in 4–6 hours a week.”Bradley also mentioned that the course is unique from others, noting that students eventually get to apply what they’ve learned through a “blockchain opportunity analysis.” He described this as “a hands-on opportunity to come up with and analyze a blockchain application in a student’s profession or organization.” Upon completing the four-course series, students receive a certificate from INSEAD, a leading graduate business school.Bradley further noted that the BRI recently launched an additional course series that specifically caters to financial-services professionals called “Blockchain Revolution in Financial Services.” This series is intended for students with a background in banking and finance who want to learn about the fundamentals of blockchain.The BRI is currently offering 50% off of the first month of the Blockchain Revolution course series.Udacity: “Become a Blockchain Developer”As blockchain adoption continues to grow, the demand for developers in the space is also increasing significantly. Udacity’s “Become a Blockchain Developer” course allows students to create their own private blockchain, secure digital assets using blockchain identity, explore the Ethereum platform, and use Solidity and smart contracts to develop a decentralized application, known as a DApp.Udacity’s CEO, Gabe Dalporto, told Cointelegraph that the overall goal of the program is to bring hands-on projects to students:“During the course, students will build a decentralized app that allows them to create, sell, and transfer ownership of a unique star token (CryptoStar) on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and the nonfungible (ERC-721) token standard.”Another project the course offers is tracking items through the supply chain. Dalporto noted that this teaches students how to manage and audit blockchain product ownership as the product is transferred down the supply chain. “This can help improve your notarization service with a smart contract to support transferring of ownership, product auditing, and supply chain management,” he explained.Other projects within the course focus on building DApps with multiple smart contracts and creating a decentralized property-listing application, where students will represent their ownership rights using zero-knowledge proofs. Tokens will then be minted to represent the claim to the property. According to Dalporto, Udacity’s blockchain developer course is unique due to its interactive experience:“This course offers an open opportunity for anyone seeking to enter the field. Plus, blockchain is still an emerging technology, so you have the chance to start making an impact right away. The critical differentiator in an emerging field is hands-on experience, and that is exactly what you’ll get in this program.”Dalporto explained that the course takes four months on average to complete, which involves about 10 hours of work per week. Upon completion, students will receive a nanodegree certification from Udacity, which Dalporto says can be added to a LinkedIn profile.Udacity is currently running a site-wide promotion of 50% off until March 24, for all those interested in signing up.Hyperledger and the Linux Foundation: Blockchain training coursesHyperledger and the Linux Foundation offer an entire catalogue of blockchain training courses, including five that are completely free to take in partnership with EdX. The executive director of Hyperledger, Brian Behlendorf, told Cointelegraph that the most popular of the free introductory courses are:LFS170 - Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and ImplicationsLFS171 - Introduction to Hyperledger Blockchain TechnologiesAccording to Behlendorf, these courses help students understand exactly what a blockchain is, and its potential to enable change around the world. “These courses allow students to analyze use cases in technology, business, and enterprise products and institutions,” Behelndorf explained. Students who complete both of the free courses are eligible to receive a professional certificate in blockchain for business from EdX.In addition to the free courses, there are more advanced programs that go into detail on how to administer and utilize specific Hyperledger projects, including Aries, Fabric, Indy, Sawtooth and Ursa. The Linux Foundation also offers certification exams for both Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth to help professionals demonstrate their knowledge and skills.Behlendorf noted that the Hyperledger blockchain courses are unique because they are designed to equip students with the knowledge necessary to prepare for Hyperledger certification exams, which is helpful for those interested in working professionally with Hyperledger.“Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications” takes about 20 hours to complete, while “Introduction to Hyperledger Blockchain Technologies” requires about 40 hours. Students interested in receiving a verified certificate of completion can obtain one from EdX for a $199 fee.Udemy: Lolli’s “Earn and Learn” programUdemy, a global marketplace for e-learning, offers over 2,000 courses related to Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain. The e-learning giant formed a partnership with Lolli, a Bitcoin-rewards platform, to provide its users with tools to learn about Bitcoin, finance and other crypto-related topics.Alex Adelman, Lolli’s CEO and co-founder, told Cointelegraph that the partnership with Udemy was initially launched to offer Bitcoin back for purchasing online courses. He noted that Lolli is now expanding its partnership with Udemy to launch “Earn and Learn,” which will start on March 24. According to Adelman, this program will include a dedicated landing page on Udemy’s site that will recommend online courses at discounted rates for Lolli users:“We understand most people are staying in their homes during this time and we want to provide resources for them to learn more about Bitcoin, specifically those who are new to Bitcoin and crypto. We want to incentivize them to spend this time learning and earning free Bitcoin in the process.”Lolli users have already streamed over 1,000 blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related courses from Udemy. Adelman expects this number to increase as more people are forced into quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic.In order to accommodate new users, Adelman said that many of the online courses selected on the Udemy/Lolli landing page will be discounted during quarantine periods. Lolli will also be increasing the rate of return so that users receive 16% back in Bitcoin, starting March 20 and lasting through April 30.Ivan on Tech AcademyWell-known crypto YouTuber Ivan on Tech launched the “Ivan on Tech Academy” to empower individuals to learn about the opportunities in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. According to Ivan, the most successful people in the space are not traders but rather builders. He told Cointelegraph:“All new industries are filled with opportunities. Imagine working with mobile apps 10 years ago or the Internet in the 90s, or computers in the 80s. However, most people miss out on the great opportunities to build a great career or a business.”In order to bring blockchain education to the masses, Ivan created his courses for individuals who do not have any prior skills or knowledge of the blockchain space. He noted that 15,000 students are currently enrolled in his program and that each student earns a certificate upon course completion. He said:“Our students gain results quickly and can build Dapps within days, as we offer a very hands-on approach. We also provide help with employment and for people interested in launching their own projects.”Other in-home learning optionsIn addition to the courses listed above, Class Central offers a database of 95 courses on blockchain and 66 courses on cryptocurrency. Additionally, a new app called Bitcoin Lessons is geared toward educating the younger generation on Bitcoin. The first four lessons are free, and students can earn Bitcoin upon course completion. Cryptocurrency-investing app Abra also just launched a free 10-day course on crypto.Finally, there are a number of cryptocurrency and blockchain influencers who offer free educational series on YouTube. For example, Crypto Wendy O’s YouTube channel consists of videos designed to break down complex indicators for individuals interested in learning more about trading."

41657," Bitcoin Is Half-Priced ‘Hurricane Insurance,’ Says Crypto Fund Manager ",2020-03-21t11:56:00+00:00,10895,143,"Travis Kling, the chief investment officer of crypto investment firm Ikigai Asset Management, has described Bitcoin (BTC) as insurance against both hurricanes and U.S. fiscal policy.On March 20, Kling tweeted that an oncoming hurricane that will soon hit the U.S. economy and “do a lot of damage.” However, all is not lost, with Kling advising that the recent crypto market crash has made half-priced hurricane insurance available to all:“You can still buy hurricane insurance. People panic sold the insurance policy bc they wanted cash. Now it's half priced from a month ago even though the hurricane is clearly here now.“Hedge fund manager likens Bitcoin to “hurricane insurance”Earlier the same day, Kling posted that BTC “is an insurance policy against the largest monetary experiment in human history,” accompanying the tweet with a graph of recent annual U.S. budget deficits.Kling’s tweet comes after the recent crypto market meltdown left Bitcoin’s long presumed safe-haven status in question — with Bitcoin plummeting 50% within 30 hours alongside hefty losses in the traditional market following U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel ban announcement on March 11.Is Bitcoin a safe haven asset?However, many within the cryptocurrency community appear not to have been naive regarding the impact of a recession or financial shock on the cryptocurrency markets. On Jan 3. Andreas Antonopoulos said that crypto will likely crash hard during the outset of a mainstream financial meltdown, adding:“And the reason it will crash hard is because a lot of the venture capital, corporate investments and private investment from individuals that is based on cheap money and disposable income and excess cash in portfolios etc., like in any other part of the economy, will dry up.”Antonopolous’ sentiments were later echoed by Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano on a March 12 episode of his podcast — where Pomp argued that the crash was caused by a liquidity crisis in which “investors all rush to the exit doors at the same time” in a bid to realize fiat.Pompliano predicted that Bitcoin, like gold during the 2008 financial crisis, will quickly recover from the initial liquidity crisis as governments cut interest rates and initiate quantitative easing — driving investors toward “safe haven assets” and “sound” monetary commodities.Last month, the Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath Palihapitiya also likened BTC to insurance."
41656, EY Japan to Fight Counterfeit Sake With Blockchain ,2020-03-21t10:07:00+00:00,7003,170,"EY Japan, the Japanese branch of global accountancy firm Ernst & Young, has announced plans to launch a blockchain system for tracking Japanese sake and fruit and preventing the sale of fraudulent or counterfeit products.According to Asian Nikkei Review, EY Japan’s SAKE Blockchain will be rolled out across Asia once the threat of the coronavirus and a stable business environment has been reestablished in the region.The company is reportedly eying Hong Kong and Singapore as major markets that are also open to distributed ledger technologies.EY Japan to combat counterfeit produce with blockchainSAKE Blockchain’s announcement comes amid increasing exports for Japanese fruit and sake — with foreign demand for the alcoholic beverage growing 5.3% to $223 million in 2019, and Japanese fruit exports tripling over the past decade.The blockchain will be used to track and record detailed information across the supply chain for Japanese produce including information on the origin of production and delivery routes.Sake consumers to access blockchain database via QR codeInformation regarding sake’s ingredients and brewery will also be uploaded to the blockchain.EY Advisory & Consulting partner Hideaki Kajiura stated: “Being able to tell the story of the production and origin [of sake] will help to differentiate it from fake products.”Consumers will be able to access the records by scanning a QR code printed on a bottle’s labeling and will include recommendations for food pairings. The data will be accessible in three languages — English, Chinese and Korean.Detailed temperature records will also be kept throughout the supply chain in order to ensure that produce is stored in an optimal environment both while shipping and while in the possession of overseas restaurants and bottle shops.The records will also be used by sake producers to gain insights into opportunities for efficiency savings in production and targeted marketing campaigns.EY builds uses blockchain to trace wine in 2019The initiative is not EY’s first foray into tracing alcohol using blockchain, with the firm providing its proprietary DLT platform to Blockchain Wine Pte.

41655," Bitcoin Price Did Not Crash 60% Due to Coronavirus, Says Binance CEO ",2020-03-21t09:22:00+00:00,42872,219,"The coronavirus pandemic was just the spark that ignited the current global economic meltdown, not its cause, the CEO of Binance says.In a blog post on March 20, Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ” in cryptocurrency circles, argued that coronavirus had shown that the world’s economy is far too weak.CZ: The economy “should be stronger”Asked whether he felt conditions this year were different from the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008, he summarized:“In 2008, there wasn’t a pandemic pausing global economy. But I believe the Coronavirus is just a trigger, not the root cause. Our economy should be stronger, at least strong enough to survive some shocks.”Zhao was speaking as Bitcoin was increasingly decoupling from the misery facing traditional markets. After a historic daily fall last week in line with stocks indexes, this week saw a startling recovery which at one point neared 90%.Since then, BTC/USD has cooled, trading down around 7% in the past 24 hours. Unlike the legacy system, however, Bitcoin is not “broken,” says Zhao.At some point, investors will stop hoarding cash — a practice that has strengthened the dollar during coronavirus — and instead begin broadening their portfolios again. Among the destinations for wealth will be Bitcoin.“Have people bought more bitcoin yet? No, in most cases. Many of them are still panicking over toilet paper,” Zhao continued.“These changes take time to propagate in the economy. Changes don’t happen immediately when a mass population is involved.”A “safu haven”?The comments echo those of Andreas Antonopoulos, the cryptocurrency educator who predicted the impact of a financial crisis on Bitcoin with uncanny accuracy several months ago. As Cointelegraph reported, Antonopoulos said that Bitcoin would initially fall hard, as investors exited crashing stocks, but then recover.Also favoring that sequence of events was John Bollinger, the creator of the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator, who argued that investors “sell what they can” under such circumstances. The intensity of Bitcoin’s fall, however, caught him off-guard.“Truly did not see that coming, I thought it might act as a safe haven asset,” he tweeted at the time.For Zhao, however, it was clear that Bitcoin will function as a safe haven in the future, given that its supply is fixed and cannot be manipulated like fiat currency.“Don’t expect bitcoin to be guaranteed to go up when the Dow Jones index crashes, or vice versa,” he said.“It’s not a perfect inverse correlation product. If you want that, you should just short the Dow Jones Index futures.”"
41653, Flying Hot Off the Shelves — Virtual Land Based on Blockchain ,2020-03-21t07:04:00+00:00,6349,171,"A couple of months ago, the crypto community was surprised by the news that users of the Decentraland virtual world platform have spent $1 million on digital land. And the largest deal for the Decentraland project was a sale worth $215,000 to an unknown user.Each plot in Decentraland represents a patch of land in a 3D virtual world, in which participants can do almost anything they want. The virtual world is not endless, and each token within the project is assigned 10 square meters.Blockchain projects that allow users to own virtual property and items, including land, have been gaining momentum. Similarly, virtual reality began to develop only in the last couple of years, though the technology behind it has been available for some time. Currently, there are many projects using VR: in education, design, gaming and, of course, real estate.This is the moment blockchain technology and cryptocurrency have been waiting for, because they can be applied seamlessly to help the aforementioned industries. Blockchain technology works with the principle of a self-organizing distributed ledger, on which counterfeiting digital currencies is almost impossible because, at any stage, transaction information is known to all of the network’s participants.When people realized that it is convenient and safe to use cryptocurrencies in the real estate industry, transactions began to flood in: People can now buy houses with Bitcoin (BTC), arrange a mortgage on a blockchain and take a virtual tour of houses that are still under construction.The idea that people who have experience building digital spaces can also construct virtual worlds has slowly seeped into the blockchain sphere. Therefore, new projects have begun to appear, such as Decentraland, where players can own virtual land in the game and just like in the real world, they can sell or rent it.Radoslav Dragov — the blockchain lead in Europe for International Data Corporation (IDC) — believes that the blockchain itself is a digital asset and that tokenization of physical or virtual assets opens up investment opportunities for more people:“Using blockchain to create digital representation of a real tradable asset can provide greater accessibility to assets that cannot be easily exchanged or require a high minimum investment. For example, tokenization of illiquid assets such as real estate gives many people the opportunity to invest small sums of money in a particular piece of land and then sell the tokens on the secondary market. The same principle can apply for virtual assets. This process of asset tokenization is democratizing investments.”An additional impulse to the development of the virtual world is given by large global IT companies, which are at the forefront of technological development. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg spoke at the annual F8 conference in San Jose about the company’s plans: “Augmented reality and virtual reality are about delivering a sense of presence — the feeling that you’re right there with another person or in another place.” More specifically, the goal is to create the ability to communicate with an avatar of a real person using a VR headset.Best blockchain virtual land projectsLike many other IT-fields, in which blockchain technology is already actively used, projects have appeared in the segment and some are attracting multimillion investments from established gaming firms like Square Enix and its $2 million financing of The Sandbox. Here are some promising VR blockchain platforms, why they need decentralization, and what their main differences are from one another.DecentralandDecentraland is a VR platform where players can create, sell and buy virtual items. The main idea of ​​the project is to create a virtual space that users can own. Platform participants can acquire plots of virtual land — 10 by 10 meters — and create any objects on them from cities to small shops and do whatever they want on their property.The idea of ​​the project appeared back in 2015 but was actively developed in 2017 after the project’s initial coin offering, which raised $20 million. The Decentraland platform uses its own cryptocurrency called MANA, which is an ERC-20 token. MANA is used to buy plots of land or to purchase goods and services in Decentraland.The platform was conceived by its creators to be fully decentralized in response to the community’s request for a free virtual world where the power over content lies in the hands of the users, and not the administration.According to the project’s announcement, Decentraland was officially presented to the public in February 2020. The launch was followed by the creation of a DAO (full decentralization of the world’s infrastructure), designed to ensure complete decentralization of the platform, thereby accelerating the exchange of data among users and the way content is exchanged on the platform.Lands by SandboxIn 2019, one of the largest computer game developers, Sandbox, created a decentralized blockchain gaming platform where, like in Desentraland, users can buy land in virtual space for real money and use it as they please.The first sale of territories in Lands took place at the end of 2019, and in February 2020, developers sold land for a second time. Within a few days of the second presale, around $200,000 was spent by users. Among the buyers were both ordinary gamers and large gaming companies, such as CryptoKitties, My Crypto Heroes, Old Skull Games as well as Dapp.com.The third and last sale announced in mid-March contained 10% of the available supply for sale in the project’s metaverse. LAND token sales are conducted using Ether (ETH) or Dai (DAI). The cost of one LAND token, which corresponds to a certain area of the ​​virtual world in the Sandbox metaverse, is $48. In total, developers plan to conduct five rounds of LAND token sales, and the launch of the gaming platform will take place later in 2020. Sebastien Borget, co-founder and chief operations officer of The Sandbox, told Cointelegraph about how players could use their virtual squares of land:“In The Sandbox, LANDS are the epicenter of our user-generated content platform. A LAND is a digital piece of real estate in The Sandbox metaverse that players can buy to build experiences on top of. Once you own a LAND, you will be able to populate it with games and assets. Each LAND is a unique (nonfungible) token lying on the public Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721). A total of 166,464 LANDS will ever be available, contained in a map that will form The Sandbox metaverse.”CryptoVoxelsCryptoVoxels is an open, sandbox-like environment, in which there are no specific goals, and users are free to do and create whatever they want. In fact, it is a stripped-down version of Decentraland, and like its competitor, it’s virtual land based on the Ethereum blockchain and works through nonfungible tokens. The app draws inspiration from Minecraft with its minimalistic interface and simpler visual effects.The virtual land in CryptoVoxels is not very diversified: The world is growing rapidly, and it will not be more than 36 by 18 kilometers. However, the project slightly differs from the others: The cheapest piece of ground costs two times less than in Decentraland — around $240.CryptoVoxels has been improving its sales. According to a report, users made 130 deals between March 12–16, which amounted to $66,800 in trading volume. In comparison, during the same period, Decentraland users completed 53 deals, which corresponds to a weekly trading volume of $22,300.Somnium SpaceSomnium Space is a cross-platform, social VR world that was launched in 2018. It allows anyone to buy land and build or import objects to create a common virtual universe. The project allows its players to use VR headsets such as HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.In Somnium Space, users can choose three different plots of land: small (200 square meters), medium (600 square meters) and large (1,500 square meters). Each size has its own height limit.In February 2020, Somnium Space officially announced the launch of version 2.0, adding new features to enhance the user experience. Built-in integration with NFTs has been added to the virtual world, allowing users to place any NFT directly on their Somnium land plots and explore them.In addition to Somnium Space, developers will launch their own in-game currency called Somnium Cubes (CUBE). This currency is intended to facilitate microtransactions in Somnium Space, such as paying for teleportation to the other side of the world or renting an item. Landowners will be able to use Cubes to purchase user-created content.From reality to blockchainNowadays, amid the thriving digital economy, there has been a steady trend toward the development of virtual reality and property, which has real economic value. The next step for VR may be the pursuit of a sustainable, equal and transparent digital world, which Borget confirmed:“There should no longer be virtual frontiers, even in the digital space. If we compare the currency flow in and flow out of metaverses just like real-world countries, then we should embrace the idea of free circulation of goods (creations and games) and people (players) between these virtual worlds. Giving control back to players by enabling them to reutilize their game elements across several games can reinforce the value of these game elements, as well as be used as a user acquisition strategy by other game developers.”However, Dragov said that blockchain technology, like the digital currency space, which is fully protected by code and a distributed network, can push the development of the digital economy:“Asset tokenization holds great potential to disrupt the financial industry, and it will gain more traction in the next five years. Making concrete predictions is difficult because regulation, which is the main impediment to widespread tokenization, is often undefined, likely to change and varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Nonetheless, asset tokenization is one of the innovative applications of blockchain that has real staying power.”"

After this week’s stellar 82.4% recovery from $3,775, Bitcoin was somewhat overdue for a pullback and as discussed in previous analysis the price was expected to retest underlying support at either $5,900, $5,500 or $5,380.BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewDespite the $1,000 drop to $5,670, the RSI on the 4-hour timeframe remains in an uptrend, above the ascending trendline in bullish territory with a reading of 62.The MACD has begun to curve down from the overbought region but the momentum on the histogram remains steady and buy volume is on par with the sell volume that preceded the pullback.If bulls can reclaim the $6,400 level and close here that would be a victory for Bitcoin price.What to watch forOver the next 4 to 6 hours, traders should keep an eye on trading volume on the shorter time frames and also watch to see if the RSI dips below the rising trendline on the 4-hour timeframe.There is also a Dragonfly Doji candle on the 4-hour chart suggesting that even though bulls absorbed the selling by buying into the pullback there is still the possibility of a short-term trend reversal, as hinted by the MACD, RSI and ailing purchasing volume.BTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIn the event of a short-term trend reversal, traders will look for a bounce at the $5,450 support where a high volume node of the volume profile visible range resides. Ultimately, after a strong upsurge from the weekly low, Bitcoin needed to retest underlying support anyhow, hence the reason bulls have strongly bought into the current dip.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Blockpulse offers an all-in-one box of tools for companies to manage their fundraising: financial simulation, legal documentation, electronic signature, online payment, cap table and registry of share movements managed on the blockchain.Bank of France registration is a key componentBlockpulse’s registration with ACPR Banque de France allows them specific capabilities concerning the Euro. “The registration allows Blockpulse to manage euro payment for financial instruments, issuances, and transfers,” Irzykiewicz said. “We can now manage both cash and securities flows into the same blockchain and automatize several actions through smart contracts.”Blockpulse is only available to French token issuers right now, but investors from other locations can participate in sales, pending regulatory restrictions.“In the future, we aim to expand in the European Union through Benelux and Spain,” Irzykiewicz added.Tokenized securities seem like a logical intersection of blockchain and finance, although the concept has not yet caught fire the same way ICOs did in 2017."
41647, Tezos Grants $37 Million to Ecosystem Developers ,2020-03-21t02:00:00+00:00,4781,133,"The Tezos Foundation released its second Biannual Report, detailing the group’s progress in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. Published on March 19, the report reveals that the foundation owns $635 million in assets — much more than the $232 million raised in its infamous initial coin offering.When asked how the foundation was able to achieve such a warchest, the company’s CFO, Roman Schnider, revealed to Cointelegraph that the project benefited from positive crypto market dynamics. He said:“The increase is largely due to the appreciation of our blockchain assets over the last three years, BTC and XTZ in particular.”The report focuses on the foundation’s usage of its funds, revealing that it offered more than $37.6 million in grant funding for the Tezos (XTZ) ecosystem since August 2019.The grants are divided into three main categories, consisting of research and development efforts, ecosystem projects, and community support. Anyone applying for a grant must pass a complex four-step process, where the proposal is evaluated by several committees and undergoes due diligence reviews. The process is managed entirely within the Tezos Foundation, which approved 78 grants out of more than 200.Notable grants in late 2019Though the foundation does not disclose the specific funding amounts awarded to each project, the report notes that payments are subject to the completion of specific milestones.Research efforts are currently heavily focused toward Tezos’ smart contract languages. Organizations such as Blockmatic, Buidl Labs, Kyoto University, The Marigold Project, and others, were all funded for developing Tezos’ smart contract languages. Other grants were awarded to Cryptium Labs, DaiLambda, and Nomadic Labs for their work on Tezos core software, including staking, privacy, and performance enhancements.More than 40 organizations received grants for developing ecosystem tools and applications. This includes several implementations of Tezos block explorers, and staking tools developed by separate companies.Grants were also given to Tezsure, an insurance platform based on Tezos, and camlCase, a company working on bringing decentralized finance to Tezos.Some $13 million were also awarded to local Tezos communities across the globe. Most of them are engaged in spreading awareness of the project by organizing meetups and hackathons. Communities providing educational material are also being financially supported.Plenty of reservesAs Cointelegraph previously reported, one of the major purported drivers of Tezos’ popularity is its foundation’s war chest.By contrast, the Ethereum Foundation’s (EF) wallet currently holds $85 million worth of ETH. This approximately matches the figure the foundation disclosed in May 2019 as part of a $30 million funding commitment.Though EF reports fiat reserves as well, two more funding rounds of that magnitude would consume the majority of its available capital — while Tezos could continue funding projects at a similar rate for at least seven years."
41646, P2P VPN Provider to Offer Their Services to Journalists for Free ,2020-03-20t23:00:00+00:00,3866,109,"U.S-based Peer-to-Peer VPN Provider Orchid will start offering a private network for free to journalists across the globe, according to an announcement made on March 20.According to Orchid, journalists who have press credentials and proof of status, regardless of their geographical location, can send an email to the company so they can access the network.VPN free as a measure against press censorshipSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Dr. Steven Waterhouse, CEO and co-founder of Orchid Labs, made some comments regarding the motivations that led the VPN provider to offer such a feature:""In the wake of crises, freedom of the press often gets restricted. This was demonstrated this week when the Chinese government announced that they would require journalists with expiring press credentials to return them and leave the country. Due to these latest circumstances, Orchid wants to ensure journalists have the ability to access and transmit accurate information, no matter their geographic location.""Blockchain’s role in the VPN serviceWaterhouse highlighted the decentralized technology behind the services offered by Orchid, whose network allows bandwidth providers to earn Orchid digital currency (OXT).Orchid Labs' CEO highlighted the importance of decentralized blockchain characteristics in building the service, which would grant the user greater privacy. This is especially valuable for journalists residing in countries actively restricting press freedom.On blockchain-based infrastructure, Dr. Waterhouse, who has a Ph.D. in Engineering from the University of Cambridge, told Cointelegraph:""Orchid enables peer-to-peer payments for bandwidth with a probabilistic nanopayment system. This system is a novel layer-2 solution on Ethereum that captures the unforgeability, irreversibility, and censorship resistance that comes with blockchain technology, with the added benefits of negligible transaction fees and availability.""By issuing a large volume of ""lottery tickets"" to payment recipients instead of on-chain transactions, says Waterhouse, the network achieves consumer-grade confirmation speeds and negligible transaction fees, while maintaining its independence from a central issuer.The co-founder of Orchid ensures that, due to traffic directed through multiple servers, no single party can see the full picture, something he considers crucial for journalists who can take advantage of the free service."

Wilshire Phoenix CEO Bill Herrmann, in an interview with Cointelegraph, said this was “like throwing pennies at a freight train and expecting it to stop.” He added, “It may sound crazy, but I think it takes $700bn to over a $1tn to stabilize the markets.”On March 17, the Fed announced the injection of $1 trillion per day for the entire week. Today’s news stretches that time horizon until April.Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano’s thoughts on the matter suggest that the government will once again extend these operations from here. On March 20, Pompliano tweeted:“Remember when the Fed said they were only doing $1 trillion in daily repos for this week? Many of you said it would be a few days and over. I disagreed. They just announced they’ll do it through the rest of the month now. Who wants to bet it doesn’t stop there?”The entire crypto market cap was not even $1 trillion at its peakAt the height of crypto market euphoria in January 2018, the market cap of the entire crypto space hit approximately $800,000,000.The Fed will inject more than this amount every day for the rest of March.Bitcoin has held relatively solid in price during these unstable times, even amid traditional markets falling. Time will tell whether crypto’s largest asset has decoupled from other markets again, as well as what the effect of these cash injections on the crypto space will be."
41644, World Federation of Exchanges Says Crypto Terminology Needs Clarity ,2020-03-20t21:53:00+00:00,1176,80,"Responding to crypto-related regulatory framework from the European Union, the World Federation of Exchanges, or WFE, called for clarity between digital asset and crypto asset classifications.“We believe there could be value in adopting a single EU classification which covers both: digital-assets and also crypto assets, as a subcategory,” the WFE wrote in response to questions posed in a March 20 report.A new industry charts murky watersBlockchain and crypto have only been around for just over a decade, so terminology and regulation surrounding the space is still developing. At present, the public labels Bitcoin, stablecoins and other assets as anything from digital assets to magic internet money.Regulation around this new industry has also faced similar uncertainty. In the WFE’s write-up, the organization referred to these as crypto assets, to avoid confusion.The WFE references global applicationThe document noted the WFE wants its crypto terminology to adapt to global industry changes and rulings. The WFE wrote:“Whilst a more universal classification would be welcome in the crypto asset taxonomy, it will be important to consider this in an internationally applicable manner and to have the suitable flexibility within that classification to mould to international classifications as they develop.”The organization said that such clarity would improve EU collaborations within itself, as well as across other regions worldwide.“It is important that definitions should aim to facilitate greater clarity on the types of asset that already fall within the regulatory perimeter and the type of platforms where they are available,” the WFE said, emphasizing the importance of avoiding technical terms that may rapidly become outdated.The organization also said that the terms chosen should carry the related regulatory guidelines behind them.The subject of standardizing the language of cryptocurrency has seen a great deal of interest around the world. In the United States, a congressman recently introduced a bill proposing a comprehensive scheme to divide all digital assets into three categories.The WFE pushed against the banning of crypto derivatives trading, which the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, considered restraining in 2019.Cointelegraph reached out to the WFE for additional details but received no response as of press time.

41642, Genesis Mining: If Economic Crisis Deepens Bitcoin Will Shine as the New Gold ,2020-03-21t01:00:00+00:00,10779,283,"Philip Salter, head of operations at Genesis Mining, believes that economic meltdown may lead to a growing value for Bitcoin as a hedge against the banks.In the last couple of weeks, there has been a lot of turmoil in the Bitcoin world. There was a rapid decline in hashrate, followed by an even more precipitous price drop. This was particularly troublesome in view of the impending halving.Cointelegraph has had an in-depth conversation on these topics with one of the most prominent figures in the Bitcoin mining space, Phil Salter.Bitcoin miners have margin calls tooSpeaking on whether miners played a major role in the recent market decline, Salter observed:“It’s no different from traditional markets, you have to sell everything to keep the operations going, to pay off your debts. As a miner you have bills to pay, you have to pay for electricity, for operations; and your expenses are in dollars, so as the price of bitcoin is dropping, it means you have to sell more of your inventory just to keep going.”Up to a point, it’s a snowball effect — as price falls, miners are forced to sell more of their inventory, and as they are selling more — the surplus in supply drags the price further down. However, there is a point when for a given miner, it makes more sense to shut off electricity and halt production until markets begin to recover.Bitcoin as the new goldOne of Bitcoin’s most popular narratives has always tried to portray it as the new gold. However, Bitcoin has been breaking away from that narrative by following the trajectory of the traditional markets. Whether this latest reversal will continue largely depends on the severity of the crisis, Salter believes:“If this economic crisis is contained, then it will not have major implications for Bitcoin. However, if there is a real collapse, then the interest in Bitcoin will explode. It will go back to being seen as a hedge against the banking system. The more skepticism people will have in the old economy, the more they will flock to Bitcoin.”With the third Bitcoin having just 53 days away, things are about to get even more interesting."
41641, Chrono Tech Launches Australian Dollar Stablecoin in Spite of ‘Big Four’ Banks ,2020-03-21t00:00:00+00:00,4042,129,"Australian blockchain firm, Chrono Tech, has been experiencing difficulties securing a banking partner amid the launch of an Australian dollar (AUD)-pegged stablecoin earlier this month.The AUD Token (AUDT), available on Chrono Tech’s platform, can be redeemed 1:1 for Australian dollars held by a licensed Australian bank. However, as Chrono Tech’s CEO, Sergei Sergienko, reveals, securing a banking partner was not easy.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Sergienko discussed his company’s transition from planning a “labor hour token” to launching a stablecoin, and the regulatory and banking climates for crypto companies in Australia.Australia’s ‘Big Four’ banks still hesitant to partner with crypto companiesSergienko said that “the hardest challenge” involved in the stablecoin’s development and launch was finding a bank that could hold it in reserve:“There was discussion with a couple of the big four [Australian banks], and everybody in their research teams were excited about it, but nobody wanted to take the first step.”Despite getting turned down by Australia’s oligopoly, Chrono Tech quickly found that many smaller banks were looking at blockchain as an exciting niche:“The new banks are very receptive towards crypto, because as they struggle to gather adoption and [try] to switch people to them, they are looking at crypto as a niche of sorts. They don't throw you out the minute they hear crypto.”That said, he’s reluctant to name the bank in case the publicity gives them cold feet.AUD stablecoin to streamline international commerceSergienko told Cointelegraph that he hopes the fiat-backed ERC-20 token will become a popular means for Australians to transfer money and make payments, both domestically and internationally:“The ideal use case for it is when somebody pay for something or gets money in an account in AUD, and they want to send it their friends, or pay for something — a service in the U.S. or whatever — they just click a button and the guy on the other end will receive in a couple of Ethereum blocks.”He states, “What I would like to see happening is AUD converted into AUDT, AUDT converted into USDC or USDT, [and] then converted into USD — all seamless and integrated. That’s what we are striving for.”Chrono Tech transitions from ‘Labour Hour Token’ to stablecoinThe company initially began work on something called a ‘Labour Hour Token’ (LHT) in 2016. That was a token backed by legally-binding contractual obligation to provide real-world labor hours.However, they shifted to the creation of an AUD-backed stablecoin roughly 12 months ago:“It became apparent that [LHT] was too hard for people to understand, so we thought a stablecoin based on AUD would be more appropriate, since we are based in Australia.”Sergienko noted that Chrono Tech encountered few regulatory challenges in issuing the stablecoin, stating that it “definitely was not difficult” to get the licensing required to convert between cryptocurrencies and fiat currency.AUDT was launched at the start of March and is integrated into the Chrono Tech ecosystem. Chrono Tech’s platform also includes PaymentX — an automated cryptocurrency payroll solution for individuals and businesses, TimeX — a Plasma-based hybrid exchange, and LaborX — a cryptocurrency-powered freelance marketplace."

The consortium has investment backing from Arrington Xrp Capital, Dekrypt Capital, and Alphabit.The UPA appears to be heavily intertwined with Uphold, with user funds stored in the Uphold reserve. UPEUR and UPUSD are both minted and redeemed through Uphold accounts. Most of the UPA’s executives also hold positions at either Cred or Uphold.Upon its launch in October 2018, UPUSD was promoted as both a stablecoin and a means to access Uphold’s lending platform."

41637, Less Than 1% of Australians Used Crypto to Pay for Services in 2019 ,2020-03-20t21:15:00+00:00,1522,108,"While some Australian authorities recognize cryptocurrencies as a form of investment, digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) are apparently not very popular as means of payment in the country.Australia’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), says that less than 1% of Australians used cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to make a consumer payment in 2019.Australian consumers increasingly prefer to use electronic payment methodsThe data is based on RBA’s own study, conducted in October and November 2019. Released on March 19, the RBA’s latest report is the fifth comprehensive survey of consumer payments in Australia. The purpose of the survey, which aggregated results from 1,100 people, was to find out more information about local payment preferences.According to the RBA, the survey has provided further evidence that Australian consumers increasingly prefer to use electronic payment methods. In line with the growing role of digital commerce, Australians are specifically aware of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.Crypto is the third most familiar alternative payment method in AustraliaDespite very few people using crypto for payment in Australia in 2019, the awareness level about the method is not low at all. According to the RBA’s data, over 80% of people had heard of cryptocurrencies, making it the third most familiar alternative payment method after “buy now, pay later” services and “tap and go” mobile payments.As such, even more people in Australia are aware of cryptocurrencies as a payment method than services like in-app mobile payment, AliPay, or WeChat Pay, according to the RBA’s findings.Awareness of alternative payment methods in Australia. Source: RBARBA reviews retail payments regulation in response to surge of e-payments roleIn the report, the RBA outlined the growing importance of electronic payments, emphasizing the increasing demand for low-cost, secure means of payment. In response to this, the bank said that it is now preparing a review of retail payments regulation for 2020. This review would consider a wide range of issues like competition, efficiency, and security of retail payments.Crypto’s high level of user awareness in Australia may be due in part to the Australian government’s overall supportive view of the technology. In mid-2019, the country’s Department of the Treasury excluded cryptocurrencies from its new 10,000 AUD ($6,900) cash limit, as reported by Cointelegraph. Australia has also been actively involved in blockchain development, releasing its national blockchain roadmap in February 2020.On Feb. 27, the district court of New South Wales ruled that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be used as a security, with a judge claiming that crypto is “a recognized form of investment.”"
41636," Steem Community Resists Takeover, Hard Fork Launches Hive Network ",2020-03-20t21:20:00+00:00,5478,210,"The Steem (STEEM) blockchain community continues to oppose Steemit in the wake of the recent “takeover” orchestrated by Justin Sun, the startup’s new owner. On March 18, “a large group of Steem community members” announced its intention to hard fork the Steem blockchain and create a new platform called Hive.The network split that was scheduled for Friday, March 20, successfully took place at around 10.30AM CET, and the market already seems to be reacting to the news, as the price of STEEM token decreased by over 20% to around $0.23 as of press time. Hive is an exact code fork of the Steem blockchain, although the platform will undergo various alterations based on community feedback.Steem vs. Steemit vs. Tron — what’s the difference?Steem is a blockchain developed by Ned Scott and Dan Larimer. It was launched in March 2016 with Steemit Inc. emerging a few months later. The company has since released blockchain-based alternatives for major social media outlets like Reddit, YouTube and Instagram.Steem represents a delegated proof-of-stake protocol governed by a limited number of “witnesses” who are elected by STEEM holders to validate transactions on the network — similarly to miners on the original Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. Votes are allocated according to the number of tokens they hold.On Feb. 14, 2020, Scott declared that he had sold Steemit to Justin Sun — a prominent Chinese tech entrepreneur known for establishing the Tron Foundation, buying BitTorrent and spending over $4 million to have lunch with multi-billionaire investor Warren Buffet, among other things. Scott’s original announcement has since been deleted, however, the merger has been marketed as a “strategic partnership” in official press kits.As Steemit Managing Director Elizabeth Powell explained to Cointelegraph soon after the acquisition, the Tron partnership basically kept her company from going bankrupt, saying: “We’ve been in a holding pattern due to a financial lack of resources.”“The takeover”Although Steemit seemed happy with the new partnership, the community did not share its enthusiasm, as on Feb. 24, they grouped together to perform a soft fork to consolidate their power. Technically, the upgrade deactivated the so-called “ninja-mined stake,” a stash of approximately 74 million STEEM tokens, which has historically been owned by Steemit.The community representatives were worried that Steemit, now controlled by Justin Sun, might use the stake for its own profit, while apparently it is supposed to be used only for the advancement of the Steem blockchain. As Luke Stokes, a long-time Steem Witness, has previously told Cointelegraph, the stake has been a long-running concern for the community.In response to the soft fork, Tron arranged what has since been described as a “hostile takeover.” Around March 2, three major cryptocurrency exchanges that have STEEM tokens listed on their platforms, namely Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, mobilized customer deposits to stake large amounts of STEEM tokens to vote in support of removing the original witnesses.Specifically, a total of 42 million Steem Power was reportedly mobilized to push out the top-five witnesses in favor of a single user, @dev365 — an account purportedly owned by Sun himself. As a result, all of the top-20 witnesses were eventually replaced with accounts powered by Steemit, Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, all of which were created in February 2020.Sun then described the takeover as a successful attempt at defeating the “hackers” who froze 65 million STEEM tokens legally owned by Steemit, most likely referring to the “ninja-mined” stake. Sun went on to add that all reports suggesting that Steemit and Tron collaborated with exchanges on a “hostile takeover” were fake: “We wanted to protect the sanctity of private property and the interests of all from malicious hackers.”Nevertheless, soon after Sun reported defeating the “hackers,” both Binance and Huobi announced that they were removing their votes to undo the takeover. The exchanges explained that they were asked by Steemit to help with a forthcoming “upgrade/hard fork” and thus contributed unknowingly. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao went as far as to distance himself from Sun in an interview with Cointelegraph.Community starts fighting backRegardless of the Sun-designed takeover, the Steem community proceeded to reclaim its space back, actively mobilizing its tokens. As of March 6, all of the top nine, as well as the 11th, witnesses were “approved”; they had over 10,000 voters and joined the network circa 2016–2017, while the remaining 10 witnesses seemed like Steemit-affiliated players.Moreover, a discussion between a small group of Steem community members and Tron’s side, represented by Justin Sun himself, finally took place on March 3. According to the alleged recording of the private conversation, which has since been leaked, Sun said that he didn’t see the situation as a conflict between the two parties. The Tron Foundation CEO said in the purported recording:“The only reason why we voted was because our funds got frozen in the first place. Basically, the bottom line for us is as long as our fund is secure, we don’t have any other demands. We want to withdraw our votes also ASAP to give rights back to the community.”According to Dan Notestein, the CEO and founder of BlockTrades, a top-three Steem validator who has been working on the Hive project, at some point, the community couldn’t secure an electoral majority because of just one voting block. Notestein told Cointelegraph:“We reclaimed several of the top 20 spots (including the topmost spots) but not most of the spots. We were unable to obtain the majority because of one minority voting block that was voting for a few of the community witnesses AND all the Tron sockpuppet witnesses. They were doing this to enforce a stalemate in order to obtain concessions on blockchain rule changes from one side or another.”The Steem community has seriously considered holding a hard fork since the beginning of the chain’s launch and the ninja-mined stake, Stokes recalled, noting that separation discussions date back to 2016. Notestein added that another call for action started around November 2018 when Steemit reportedly laid off about 70% of its staff. Speaking for himself, Stokes said that the community has been pushed too far:“Last year, it was more about forking out the ninja mined stake on-chain. Now, it's more about moving to a new chain though that was discussed last year also. From my personal perspective, there was not enough support for it then. Given Justin's actions, there is now.”As Notestein argued in an email sent to Cointelegraph, validators’ communication with Sun has been unproductive, which is another reason why the community decided to carry on with a hard fork:“It became apparent to many of us early on that we were trying to negotiate with Justin Sun that he was only giving lip-service attention to true negotiation. We were almost always talking with his intermediaries that would promise one thing during the day only to have Justin either tweet or take an on-chain action that night that was in direct opposition to the spirit of the promises made by his intermediaries.”1:1 airdrop that ignores “ninja-mined” stakeAccording to the Hive hard fork announcement, Steem users will receive their balances through a 1:1 airdrop taken from a snapshot of the blockchain at 10 a.m. EST on March 20. However, the drop will purpodetly ignore Steemit’s “ninja-mined” stake, currently worth around $9.25 million — which is more than 20% of its $46 million market capitalization.Since Hive is a new project, “we have the luxury of free association,” James Reidy, also known as Steem/Hive witness Riverhead, told Cointelegraph when asked how exactly those in control of the ninja-mined stake will be picked out:“The exclusions for the airdrop fall into two categories: Steemit Inc. Ninja-Mined Stake (SINMS), and those that supported the sock puppet witnesses and, by extension, centralization. A lot of the SINMS that has not been sold off still resides with the accounts that mined them or only a transfer or two away. It is, therefore, fairly trivial to identify these accounts. While the exclusion won’t capture all the funds associated with the SINMS it will capture enough to mitigate its ability to centralize the chain. For the second category of exclusions, the Steem blockchain serves as a perfect, immutable record of which accounts have either voted for Justin Sun’s sock puppet witnesses or proxied their vote to accounts that voted for them.”In both cases, there is no monitoring required, said Reidy, because those events have already taken place, and the airdrop code only needs to reference that history. “It is very important to note that non SINMS accounts that are being excluded in the initial airdrop may be included at a future date if the community desires,” he added.Exchanges start backing up the community-lead projectA number of exchanges seem supportive of the Hive project, with Binance being one of the first firms to back the upcoming airdrop. David Jefferys, director of business development of V.systems, who has previously worked a similar job at Steemit for two years and now partakes in the Hive hard fork, told Cointelegraph:“Leveraging the great news from Binance early on in the day myself and a handful of other Hive (formerly Steem) community members worked to coordinate exchange communications with other key industry exchanges.”Reidy also informed Cointelegraph that so far, eight exchanges have announced their intention to support the Hive airdrop: Binance, Huobi, Bithumb, GOPAX, Ionomy, KuCoin, ProBit and Upbit, with more contacting the Hive team daily.According to Reidy, at this point, the Hive team already employs around 100 people, among whom there are about 50 developers. The Steem/Hive witness added that “this is a low estimate,” given that more people join every day. Jeffreys went on to say that “things are happening quickly” and “former Steemit, Inc. dev(s) are helping out here and there when necessary.” He also told Cointelegraph that the current Hive team banded together in a Slack group called “Newchain” soon after Sun’s purchase of Steemit was announced, explaining:“The key motivating factor was not the acquisition itself but Justin Sun's announcement that there would be a token and DApp migration from the Steem blockchain to the Tron blockchain, effectively killing Steem.”When asked whether Hive is a nonprofit or a business entity, Jefferys replied with: “Hive isn't even a company or official organization yet. There's been no time. It's a pure, community-driven, truly decentralized social blockchain project.”In conversations with Cointelegraph, many seemed optimistic about the hard fork’s future, with Scott Jarvie, co-founder of SteemPeak, the second largest content posting interface on Steem after steemit.com, telling Cointelegraph: “I would expect about 95%+ of our active users to migrate to the new chain,” adding:“However, not all of the original userbase will migrate because many users are probably just not active enough to care. I expect at least 50% to dabble on both chains for a little while.I expect by the end of summer Steem Chain to be almost empty unless Justin Sun decides to hire developers and do something new and interesting with Steem.

Currently, the SEC seems to be pursuing fines and disgorgement rather than jailtime for those involved.Claims of art and gold assetsMeta 1 claimed its tokens were backed, but the cited backing shifted over time, from some $1 billion of rare art to, more recently, $2 billion in gold.Meta 1’s LinkedIn page currently reads ““META 1 is a Private Digital Currency backed by humanity's greatest assets. We provide the liquidity of gold.” The SEC’s complaint says “In reality, the Coin is backed by nothing.”Former state senator and repeat scammerOne of the major backers of Meta 1 named in the complaint is Dave Schmidt, a former Republican Senator for the state of Washington.Shady dealings checker Schmidt’s past. He lost a re-election campaign for his seat in Washington in 2006, after which he faced investigation for misspending over $40,000 in campaign funds.At least one commentator spotted Schmidt feigning access to vast stores of gold via his website back in 2016 — two years before the SEC says Meta 1 began operations.Sky-high promisesThe SEC claims Meta 1 managed to raise over $4.3 million since April 2018 by promising investors “exorbitant” returns. According to the complaint:“While the particular rate of return constantly varied, it was always exorbitant. For example,Schmidt and Dunlap represented that each Coin (sold for $22.22 or $44.44, depending on when it was purchased) would be worth up to $50,000—up to a 224,923% return—as a ‘very conservative value.’”The complaint continues to reject Meta 1’s claims of providing a backed coin:“As Defendants knew, or were severely reckless in not knowing, Meta1 owned no significant assets, including either art or gold, so there was no reasonable basis for Defendants to project any investment returns, let alone such exorbitant returns.”An ongoing scamThe SEC describes Meta 1 as an “ongoing securities fraud.” As of press time Meta 1’s website — which features the central pitch “Empowering Humanity” — was still online. Its Twitter and LinkedIn pages had also been active recently.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, a whistleblower recently outed a Ukrainian Bitcoin-trading scam that allegedly netted $70 million in 2019 and employed 200 people."
41634," IRS Delays Tax Day to July 15, Still Monitors Crypto ",2020-03-20t20:49:00+00:00,2228,91,"Like other financial markets, crypto investors have seen wild swings and devaluations in recent weeks as Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, issues have hit many people all over the world. With safety concerns paramount, it can be easy to forget for a time about more pedestrian issues like taxes. But taxes won’t go away entirely. The United States Internal Revenue Service’s main tax filing deadline remains as April 15, but there is a 90-day reprieve on payments to the IRS until July 15, according to IRS Notice 2020-17.Does this mean you don’t have to file by April 15? For much of this week, taxpayers and their tax preparers were gearing up for a situation where tax returns were due on April 15, but payment on those returns wouldn’t be due until July 15.The extension of the filing deadline to July 15 to match the extended payment deadline has happened much more recently. Indeed, presently, the “announcement” of the filing extension consists of two tweets made by Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.The first simply provides that the Treasury Department is “moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties.” The second tweet reminds taxpayers who expect to receive tax refunds that they can always file before the extended filing deadline in order to get their tax refunds sooner. Of course, we should all keep our eyes open for a more formal IRS announcement, which may contain more helpful details about the filing extension.In particular, it is not clear at this time how much of the earlier announced payment extension will be affected or superseded by the more recent filing extension. Before the filing deadline was also extended, the IRS said that the payment relief is available for income tax payments due April 15, 2020. This includes federal estimated tax payments due April 15, 2020.Related: Are You Ready for the New Crypto Tax Season?Crypto investors should still gather records for 2019. What’s more, those who need to fix their past reporting should not forget about that either. With all the IRS enforcement efforts about crypto, filing amended tax returns before the IRS gets to you is better than waiting for an audit or worse. When we all come out the other side of this, we should remember that the IRS still cares a lot about crypto taxes.Related: IRS Crypto Tax Return Question — Be Careful How You AnswerNoncorporate taxpayers can defer up to $1,000,000 of tax liability until July 15, and that includes both 2019 and the first-quarter 2020 tax payments combined.For individuals, the amount of deferred tax payment is $1,000,000 regardless of filing status, meaning it is the same for a single individual and for married individuals filing a joint return. However, the notice did not address whether married individuals filing separate tax returns would each receive a $1,000,000 deferment benefit. The deferment includes income tax and also applies to payments of tax on self-employment tax too.Corporations get a benefit too. They can defer up to $10,000,000 of tax liability until July 15, this includes both 2019 and first quarter 2020 tax combined.Finally, don’t forget about state taxes. If you file state income tax returns, you need to consider their rules too, since they are not covered by the IRS guidance. But many states are providing their own piggyback relief. In high-tax California, the state’s Franchise Tax Board announced that both filing and payment deadlines have been extended to July 15 for 2019 tax returns. That extension applies to first and second quarters estimated tax payments too. The board has also posted a chart showing all of the California details.Does all of this more generally mean a kinder and gentler IRS or state tax administrators? It is hard to tell, but you should not count on it. Thus, if you have installment payments due, or owe the IRS or a state taxing authority a response to a tax notice by a certain date, it would be best to try to meet it. There might conceivably be some latitude given because of the extraordinary circumstances people are now facing. But it is best not to count on it.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Robert W.

41632, Crypto Hedge Fund Goes Belly Up After Bitcoin Price Drop to $3.8K ,2020-03-20t20:36:00+00:00,57071,414,"Cointelegraph has learned that crypto hedge fund Adaptive Capital, will shutter all operations after taking heavy losses during the March 13 crypto market meltdown which saw Bitcoin (BTC) price drop to a 2020 low at $3,775. As first reported by The Block,the fund has issued a letter to its investors announcing the closure of the fund and the return of all remaining assets to investors.The hedge fund had previously reported gains over 552.77% from October 3, 2018, through May 3, 2019. The letter to investors is said to cite a series of infrastructural problems with a trading venue as the primary cause of the losses.Although the venue hasn’t been named in Adaptive Capitals’ letter to investors, BitMex was inoperational for almost an hour during the massive sell-off, leaving the hedge fund operators unable to respond to the market.BitMex has since reported on this and has blamed a DDoS attack for the down period.“We have identified the root cause of two DDoS attacks at 02:16 UTC and 12:56 UTC, 13 March 2020. For a full account of what happened and how we are responding.”Did Adaptive Capital miss the signal?Since dropping from $10,500, Bitcoin’s price action had already taken a bearish slant and the digital asset’s positive trend seems to have been broken on Feb. 26, when the daily candle failed to gain above $9,200. This completed a head and shoulders pattern and was followed by a strong downside move for Bitcoin.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bloodbath that ensued was unpredictable as no one, including Adaptive Capital, seemed to expect a devaluation of around 50%, leaving Bitcoin near $3,775, a price point that hasn’t been seen since April last year.Like many institutional investors, Adaptive Capital likely had the longer Bitcoin’s price action on longer timeframes in mind. Proof of this comes from an August 2019 tweet from Murad Mahmudov, former Goldman Sachs analyst and the Chief Investment Officer at Adaptive Capital.In the tweet Mahmudov showed just how bullish he was by predicting a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin in the long-run:“At first glance this looks like a weak chop for the next week or so, but my intuition tells me there is steady accumulation happening at these levels. Don't try to outsmart yourself on short timeframes, zoom out & think big. In my view, BTC is going to $100K per orangecoin.”Crypto hedge funds: Another one bites the dustCrypto Funds gained popularity with crypto and traditional finance investors, especially in 2018, fueling many of the companies and projects available today. These typically range from hedge funds like Alliance Capital to venture capital funds like the Digital Currency Group.It is not uncommon to see traditional venture capital firms delve into crypto which shows some level of institutional demand for cryptocurrencies.In a report published in May 2019, PwC estimated that in 2018 150 active crypto hedge funds collectively managed $1 billion in assets, and despite the negative performance of many new and ambitious crypto hedge funds are still being created, although the number of new funds has now decreased by more than half in 2019 compared to the year before.Despite signals of institutional demand for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, this has failed to materialize in 2019 and hedge funds can only take so many losses before they throw in the towel. According to a December 2018 report from Crypto Fund Research nearly 70 crypto hedge funds have shut down.SEC Bitcoin ETF rejections stymie investor demandIn the meantime, exchange traded funds continue to see rejections from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amid concerns that the Bitcoin market is simply too prone to manipulation. Most recently, the SEC rejected another ETF submission by Wilshire Phoenix. The NY-based firm was hoping to hedge against Bitcoin’s volatility by including US Treasury bonds in the basket.As the current Coronavirus situation unfolds, it is hard to say how hedge funds and other market players will cope but as even traditional safe-haven assets like gold continue to fail, Bitcoin may find itself in completely new territory as an emerging asset class.Whether that is good or bad, it’s left to be seen but members of Adaptive Capital remain bullish nonetheless. Earlier this week, Willy Woo, partner at Adaptive Capital and self-described “pioneer in on-chain analytics” tweeted:“Dump then moon. We are undergoing flight to safety right now, BTC is looking for its bottom. But know that once the bottom is in there are strong bullish pressures ahead. It's this economic environment in the years ahead that Bitcoin was built for.”"
41631, Honeywell: “Corporate America Needs to Change Its Mindset” ,2020-03-20t20:33:00+00:00,19282,77,"Honeywell International Inc., a publicly-traded company with an $80 billion market cap, previously announced a blockchain-based marketplace for airplane parts. According to a recent interview with Cointelegraph, they may soon begin recording your home’s carbon footprint on a blockchain ledger as well.DIY blockchain projectIn a Cointelegraph exclusive interview, Lisa Butters, general manager of Honeywell’s GoDirect Trade platform, noted that the company took an unorthodox approach to the adoption of this complex technology:“About fourteen months ago, we knew nothing about blockchain. Then, I discovered that we have a small group in India, about six developers working on incubating new technology. That is how it started. All development was done in-house and we have been deeply involved with the Hyperledger community ever since.”Paradoxically, although Honeywell’s GoDirect Trade platform is built on a permissioned Fabric blockchain, “anyone with a Gmail account can sign up and purchase airplane parts”, confirmed Butters.Since their initial announcement in December 2019, Honeywell has also been working with iTRACE on the authentication of “aerospace products via blockchain”.Your home’s carbon footprint on the blockchainButters believes that blockchain technology can be applied in many other areas as well. One of those areas is carbon emissions. Butters explains:“Honeywell must report carbon emissions for all of our facilities, we must do those calculations manually. There is an opportunity here. But it doesn’t have to be just for corporations, it could be for your home, some basic calculations, whether it's electric or diesel or gas. That is something we are looking into”.‘Walled-garden’ approach to data needs to changeButters believes many corporate blockchain projects fail because they don’t start with a clearly defined use-case:“Start with a real problem you need to solve. For us, this was a lack of trust — this is a huge $4 billion industry where everything was being done offline because there was no trust between buyers and sellers. We saw this as a great opportunity, the idea was to build something like Carfax for our industry”.Butters also observes that for Corporate America to embrace this technology, there needs to be a paradigm shift the way it thinks about data:“The technology makes sense. The reason why it hasn’t become widely accepted is that Corporate America has a ‘walled garden’ approach to data — they need to start sharing data, a huge paradigm shift”.Perhaps, the global crisis ushered by the coronavirus will serve as a catalyst for change."

41628," Hive Hard Fork is Successful, STEEM Crashes Back to Earth ",2020-03-20t19:51:00+00:00,3372,117,"Following weeks of conflict between the Steem (STEEM) community and Justin Sun, the community-led Hive hard fork was successful.On March 20, Hive hard forked the Steem network, airdropping HIVE tokens to STEEM holders 1:1, excluding the founder’s reward.The founder’s reward comprises 20% of the total STEEM supply. The tokens were acquired by Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, when he purchased Steemit Inc — the largest front-end interface for the decentralized blogging platform — on Feb. 14.A quick search through Twitter shows that many content creators are already posting on Hive.Steempeak rebrands to PeakdMany of the Hive posts are accessed through Peakd — the Hive-based portal for Steempeak.

41626," Big Brother Capitalizes on Coronavirus Fears, Crypto Industry Responds ",2020-03-20t19:35:00+00:00,1642,95,"Governments are now considering tracking online user data as a way to fight the rapid spread of COVID-19. As a result, the question of personal data privacy is increasingly becoming a subject of discussion within the crypto community.On March 17, the Washington Post reported that the United States government was in talks with internet giants like Facebook and Google about using smartphone location data to combat COVID-19. One highlighted tactic includes tracking whether people are self-isolating in a way that successfully stems the outbreak, as has already occured in Israel, China, and Iran.In recent years, leaders in the crypto space have emerged as global advocates for online privacy. Protection in the context of the coronavirus has taken these issues to a completely new level.Brave browser acknowledges recent COVID-19 statementJohnny Ryan, chief policy and industry relations officer at privacy-oriented blockchain browser, Brave, cited the COVID-19 privacy statement published by the European Data Protection Board on March 16. He noted to Cointelegraph that it’s “useful to reflect on what European data protection authorities have concluded about this.” The statement reads that data protection rules do not hinder efforts to fight against the coronavirus pandemic, while stipulating that:“The public authorities should first aim for the processing of location data in an anonymous way (i.e. processing data aggregated in a way that it cannot be reversed to personal data). This could enable to generate reports on the concentration of mobile devices at a certain location (“cartography”).”David Birch states that location tracking to save lives makes complete senseDavid Birch, internationally-recognized advisor on digital identity and Blockchain evangelist, believes that it makes sense for the government to track infectious people’s locations in “exceptional circumstances” if lives are saved as a result. Birch stated that:“Stopping the spread of the virus clearly saves lives and none of us (with a few exceptions, I'm sure) would be against temporarily giving up some of our privacy for this purpose. In fact, in general, I am sure that most people would not object at all to opening their kimonos, as I believe the saying goes, in society's wider interests.”Own Your Data Foundation to announce virtual summitOwn Your Data’s chief operating office, Brent Cohen, shared with Cointelegraph that they plan to announce a virtual summit on health and data privacy soon. Own Your Data is a digital intelligence and data privacy startup founded by blockchain-friendly Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, Brittany Kaiser. Cohen said that while governments have “legitimate reasons to harness every available resource in times of national emergency,” legal and ethical questions must be considered. He continued:“We recognize that the question of personal data privacy in a time of pandemic is an issue that society is ill-suited to address. Own Your Data Foundation will soon be announcing a virtual summit on health and data privacy. Our goal is to help provide a framework for answering the legal and ethical questions raised by this crisis. This will not happen overnight. But it needs to begin now.”Whatever people think of data privacy in normal circumstances, using personal data in emergencies is apparently a different situation. Lina Seiche, global marketing director at crypto exchange BTSE, stated:“Several countries are tracking the phones of coronavirus patients & quarantined people. Our location data has been collected for years; it was only a matter of time until it would be used in emergencies. Now it’s only a matter of time until “emergency” measures become the norm.”"

This shows that traders are not confident that the equity markets have bottomed out and possibly investors are slowly losing hope that the central banks can rescue them from any crisis.Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is showing a sharp rally from the recent lows. The total crypto market capitalization has risen from the recent low of about $118 billion on March 13 to about $191 billion on March 20, which is a rally of about 62%.

Let’s analyze the charts of the major cryptocurrencies to determine the levels, which will signal a change in trend.BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) has seen strong buying from close to the $5,000 levels, which is a huge positive. This shows that the market participants believe that the largest cryptocurrency has put a bottom at $3,803.58.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the bears are defending the resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the BTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels, we expect the bulls to step in closer to the support line of the ascending channel.If the pair bounces off the support line of the channel and rises above the 20-day EMA, a move to the 200-day EMA at $8,448 and above it to $10,500 is possible.Contrary to our assumption, if the pair turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below the support line of the channel, it can result in a fall to $5,000. We expect strong buying to emerge at these levels.Though we are positive, we suggest traders wait for the rally to prove itself before jumping in to buy. We will watch the price action for a couple of days more and then suggest a trade in it.ETH/USDThe momentum in Ether (ETH) picked up after it broke above the downtrend line. This is a positive sign.

We will watch the price action above the channel and then suggest long positions.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) is attempting to break out of the descending channel.

41618," Woman Arrested for Stealing $480,000 From Crypto Exchange She Co-Founded ",2020-03-20t17:34:00+00:00,7080,105,"A woman was arrested in Bengaluru, India on March 17 for allegedly stealing 63.5 Bitcoins (BTC) from Bitcipher Labs — a cryptocurrency exchange that she had previously co-founded.The thefts took place on January 11 and March 11 respectively, resulting in $480,000 worth of BTC being stolen from Bitcipher.Bitcipher co-founder steals $480,000 in BTCAyushi Jain, the 26-year-old former-employee, was found to have stolen 63.5 BTC from hardware wallets owned by the exchange.Indian police acted in response to a complaint filed by Bitcipher Labs’ CEO, Ashish Singhal, who had identified the two unauthorized transactions.The Bengaluru Investigation Department stated that an “investigation revealed the complainant had hardware wallets in which Bitcoins were stored, and a 24-word passphrase (password) was written on a piece of paper.”Police suspected that the thief was “someone proficient in using this technology, and who was closely associated with the firm”, due to the fact that the culprit was able to operate a cryptocurrency hardware wallet and access the funds using the wallet’s corresponding passphrase.Stolen funds were recoveredAfter preparing a list of the exchange’s former employees, Ayushi was identified as a likely suspect, as she had quit the company on Dec. 16, 2019, despite having co-founded the firm alongside Singhal in 2017.After being detained, Ayushi confessed to the theft. The stolen funds were recovered by police. A senior police officer stated:“On Wednesday, we took Ayushi into custody and searched her house. We seized a laptop which contained the history, showing how Ayushi used the passphrase and stole money in installments between January and March. She confessed to the crime. By Thursday afternoon, we recovered the entire amount.”Police seized Ayushi’s laptop, and all stolen funds have been returned to the exchange.Crypto Exchanges Rush to Enter Indian MarketIndia has become a renewed focus of the cryptocurrency community. Recently, the Supreme Court reversed the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on financial institutions, and are now providing services to businesses operating with cryptocurrencies.Despite several cryptocurrencies rushing to enter the Indian market, a recent parliamentary investigation has revealed that only two cryptocurrency exchanges are licensed with the country’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs."
41616, Brave New World: Browser Challenging Google for the Future of Privacy ,2020-03-20t16:10:00+00:00,7419,331,"On March 16, Brave, a privacy-oriented web browser, filed a formal complaint against Google with the Irish General Data Protection Regulation enforcer — since the multinational tech conglomerate’s European headquarters are located in Dublin.According to Brave, Google has been quite irresponsible with how it has been collecting and sharing the personal data of its users. Brave’s chief policy and industry relations officer Johnny Ryan went as far as saying that owing to Google’s dubious operational policies, the multimedia giant has created a “free for all” data warehouse that is not only being abused quite blatantly but is also in clear violation of the GDPR rulebook.From a technical standpoint, Google is being accused of violating Article 5(1)b of the GDPR, which states that digital data being collected by a company should be done purely for reasons that are “specified, explicit and legitimate” in nature. The article states that the acquired data should not be in any way processed in a manner that is incompatible with the aforementioned purposes. Ryan contends that by filing a “purpose limitation” complaint with the GDPR, Brave will help give individuals the power to decide which of Google’s services they choose to share their data with.Brave points the fingerIn a recent conversation with Cointelegraph, Ryan stated that even though some of Google’s individual products (such as the Search function, for example) may be using customer data appropriately, the company takes personal information collected through all of its various offerings and combines it for various ill-defined purposes:“This infringes the GDPR’s ‘purpose limitation principle.’ Brave’s evidence illustrates that there is a data free-for-all inside Google. One can never know what Google does with one’s data. If such a vast company as Google were to be permitted to operate a data free-for-all, then the GDPR would be an illusory fantasy.”Furthermore, according to a study released by Brave that takes a detailed look at a number of documents written for Google’s business clients, technology partners, developers, lawmakers and users, the company claims that the multimedia giant routinely acquires a wide array of sensitive data from its customers — via the use of different websites, apps and operating systems — and uses it for “hundreds of ill-defined processing purposes.”Providing his insights on the matter, Jesse Crouch, owner of Never Astray — a privacy-oriented firm that provides clients with detailed, 3D topographical maps — told Cointelegraph that Google obtains data from its users any way it can, calling this mode of operation the company’s “bread and butter.” On the subject, he added:“Google created its analytics product so that it has as much data as possible about the web as a whole, including the traffic to websites that don’t come from its search engine. Google Maps isn’t some super expensive philanthropic effort to give the gift of navigation to the world — it was designed to give Google as much data about locations of places and users as possible.”Cointelegraph received a similar view from Norbert Goffa, executive manager of ILCoin — a blockchain-based storage system solution — who pointed out Google’s various cases that have resulted in lawsuits worth more than $200 million. One of the most prominent ones dates back to 2010, wherein Google had made use of specially equipped cars and trucks to collect emails, passwords and other personal information which was then transmitted over unsecured Wi-Fi networks owned by tens of millions of people around the world. Goffa went on to add:“Another lawsuit against the corporation was related to inadequate protection by Google of the information of YouTube users under 13. The company’s actions violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the collection of information and the publication of data belonging to users under 13 years old without the consent of their parents.”A Brave way out?From a fresh install, Brave looks like a browser that maximizes individual privacy and security, since ads and trackers are blocked automatically. This basically means that companies like Google and Facebook no longer have the ability to monitor the real-time activity of their users.It should also be highlighted that people who make use of ad blockers and/or anti-tracking tools on Google’s native browsing service — Chrome — are often unaware that the browser automatically signs users into their personal accounts, thereby negating the overall effectiveness of most anti-tracking tools.Enumerating the various points that make Brave stand out from the rest of the fray, Catherine Corre, head of communications for Brave, told Cointelegraph that unlike other browsers, Brave makes use of a privacy-by-default foundation; the browser blocks or neutralizes tracking scripts, third-party cookies, fingerprinting methods, crypto-mining scripts and other privacy threats:“Google Chrome, in contrast, has surveillance built in: if a user logs into any Google service by a Gmail address or similar account key, by default Chrome tracks the user’s navigation for ad targeting.”On the issue, Crouch further pointed out that other browsers are now slowly beginning to catch on to the privacy standards. In this regard, Brendan Eich — the co-founder of Mozilla and creator of JavaScript — began the Brave project separately from Mozilla to get a fresh start and pursue a new business model.On a somewhat similar note, Chris Hauk, privacy advocate for Pixel Privacy, a platform that seeks to help users maximize their digital security and safety, told Cointelegraph that Brave browser’s use of specialized privacy protocols allows to load the web content faster which in turn results in a smoother browsing experience.He also pointed out that the desktop version of the browser comes equipped with the ability to deploy the Tor network to route any connection through multiple relays before reaching the desired destination. Since these connections are also encrypted, users can experience increased anonymity — all without having to load the Tor browser separately.Brave wants to up the game?Recently, the core developer team behind Brave browser announced that they are working on deploying an all-new feature called the “random browser fingerprint generator,” which will allow users to greatly enhance their individual privacy and digital security. Elaborating on the overall efficacy/utility of this feature in a bit more detail, Hauk told Cointelegraph:“Brave’s random browser fingerprint generator will make every browser session look unique, as the user moves between websites and between browsing sessions, this will make a user’s browser appear completely unique when browsing, making it difficult, if not impossible to track a user.”Browser fingerprints can be thought of as digital markers that a number of firms use to track the movements of many casual browsers in an easy, hassle-free manner. For example, something as simple as keeping one’s browser window maximized all the time can allow one’s identity to be exposed to a number of miscreants.In this regard, Brave’s latest effort to randomize its user’s digital fingerprints is being seen as a potential game changer by security experts. This, according to Crouch, is one of the many reasons Edward Snowden recommends the Linux distributions of Tails, a security-focused, Debian-based OS that, by default, randomly resizes itself to ensure that users have a minimal digital fingerprint.Elaborating on the various technical aspects of Brave’s fingerprint randomization approach, Peter Snyder, senior privacy researcher at Brave, pointed out that the technology has been designed to protect users against web-scale fingerprinting attacks:“Brave’s fingerprint randomization techniques prevent users from being uniquely fingerprinted when sites use broad, untargeted fingerprinting tools advertisers and trackers use (e.g., common open-source tools like fingerprint2.js); Brave’s fingerprinting is not likely to be robust against highly targeted identification efforts, such as those used by state actors or law enforcement.”When asked about why other companies such as Google and Microsoft don’t make use of such forward-looking technology to secure the information of their users, Snyder gave a twofold answer. Firstly, he explained that the randomization technique in question is novel and previously only existed (for the most part) in academic research. Secondly, he stated that there is a collective action problem in web privacy, where browser vendors are nervous about deploying new protection protocols out of the fear that their new schemes might break some websites.Privacy-oriented browsers are gaining more tractionRecently, it came to light that the number of individuals making daily use of Brave’s blockchain browser had surged past the four-million mark. Not only that, earlier this month, Brendan Eich tweeted that Brave’s standard web browser also has a total of 12.2 million monthly users.This meteoric rise can be attributed to Brave’s privacy-forward stance as well as it’s compatibility with a number of mainstream applications — like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Additionally, Brave runs on mobile devices as well as on desktop computers and claims to be faster by default than any other browser because of its ability to reduce the load on one’s machine.On the subject of Tor browser versus Brave, and how the two fare against each other in terms of their overall privacy and security related benefits. John Jefferies, Chief Financial Analyst at CipherTrace, crypto forensics firm, told Cointelegraph that upon doing a quick test comparing the tracking potential of the two, he found that while Tor offers more anonymity, Brave provides users with a high level of privacy. Expounding his views on the matter further, Jefferies pointed out:“The difference is important, but essentially Tor doesn’t hide user activity but obscures user details by giving a false location. Brave protects privacy by concealing all information about user activity unless the user explicitly enables cross-site trackers. As the Pew Research Center revealed in its privacy report, more people than ever are concerned about online data privacy. Increasing apprehension about the way personal data is being used may explain Brave’s extraordinary growth.”Individual privacy is the futureAs users continue to discover ways in which their browser data — as well as other personal info — is being shared among companies, more people will likely become increasingly concerned with their online privacy and anonymity. As a result, many believe that consumer interest in online security platforms such as the Brave browser, as well as other anonymity tools like VPNs, will increase quite significantly in the years to come.Additionally, Brave’s increasing popularity can be attributed to its goal of giving back to its users by way of a native cryptocurrency, Basic Attention Token (BAT). This is what sets Brave apart from mainstream web platforms like Chrome, Safari and Edge, which are not only prone to various third party intrusions (trackers, malware,etc) but also don’t offer much in monetary value to their users.The masses at large seem to have reacted very positively towards Brave. Corre highlighted that the platform has witnessed a lot of growth on the creator side of things, with the browser now boasting of more than 500,000 verified publishers, concluding:“The entire ecosystem is hungry for an alternative to the current broken ad tech ecosystem. The privacy tide is continuing to rise.”"
41611, The Promise and Reality of Blockchain’s Role in Global Elections ,2020-03-20t14:36:00+00:00,2140,159,"As fears of disinformation and election tampering take hold of citizens across the globe, many are left to wonder if there’s a solution that can quell voter concerns. A recent study by global communications firm Ketchum found growing distrust among individuals around voting machines (59%), issues with voter databases (60%), interference through technology (63%) and the influence of social media (61%).In the United States, this year’s Iowa Democratic Party caucuses left voters frustrated when a voting app resulted in incorrect and wholly unreliable results. Delays ensued, and a candidate prematurely proclaimed himself the winner, which led to questions as to whether foul play was involved. Other states like Oregon took measures to prevent voter fraud with aid from the Federal Government, while Georgia acknowledged that its servers were hacked after being left exposed on the open internet for around six months.Related: Denver Municipal Election: Another Small Stop on the Road to Universal Blockchain VotingThat’s just one country, but this is a global issue. In Israel, the entire national voter registry — containing names, phones, residential addresses and national ID numbers — was leaked. Voters in Malawi were promised a rerun after last year’s re-election win of Democratic Progressive Party leader Peter Mutharika was found unlawful due to paper ballot tampering. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico plans to fully move its voting processes onto the internet, leading the American Civil Liberties Union to urge against the move, noting it will “only result in greater public mistrust of key democratic institutions.”All of these examples have a common thread: a need for trust.Though tech served a role in a majority of these blunders, it has a chance to redeem itself. Newly emerging technologies like blockchain — designed to be transparent, decentralized and censor-resistant — can offer a solution for elections and address many security vulnerabilities.For example, blockchain was used in a hotly contested battle for the leadership of the Thai Democrat Party when its incumbent party leader wanted to renew his mandate. To appeal to the common Thai citizens and shed his elitist image, he allowed all Democrat Party members to vote for the party leader — a role traditionally selected only by other leaders within the party. While the party initially wanted to implement e-voting, rampant distrust among the candidates, including the party’s own election commission, meant they needed additional assurances that the votes would not be tampered with. In the end, they agreed that blockchain technology could bring the trust they needed to the process, choosing Zcoin (XZC), a privacy-first blockchain, as an immutable record for the votes. Data from the voting also received special encryption to further protect voters’ identities and votes. In total, 127,479 votes were cast with final results made available in under 12 hours. This is one of the world’s first and most successful applications of blockchain in a political election of this scale. Most importantly, Thai citizens — of all ages and backgrounds — were able to fairly and confidently exercise their voting rights.While blockchain has its critics and may not be a perfect solution, this election offers a glimpse into its potential to bring transparency and trust to the democratic process. In Naples, Italy, blockchain voting was deployed in 2017 and encountered mixed results around the cost of hardware and length of time taken to release the results, which was slower than traditional processes. Voatz, a leading blockchain voting app in the U.S., has been used in 54 elections, but gaping vulnerabilities were found that, if exploited, would allow hackers to view and alter votes.Related: Electronic Voting With Blockchain: An Experience From Naples, ItalyCybersecurity company Kaspersky Labs even introduced a prototype of a voting system based on a web application using Polys, a blockchain system released in 2017, as an alternative to Voatz and others. Although its software was banned by the U.S. government for fear of it being Russian spyware, other countries and regions including Belgium, the Volgograd region in southern Russia and the Taraclia region in the Republic of Moldova have reported success with votes around corporate and local initiativesMore recently, Tezos announced a partnership with Electis, a nonprofit, community-based organization, to host a smaller-scale voting experiment aimed at universities on its platform. Electis’ first ever “proof-of-concept vote” over the blockchain is expected to take place in autumn 2020 with participants from the University of Edinburgh and Polytechnique in Paris.Related: Tezos Has Renewed Hope in 2020, but the Comeback Kid Is Still UntestedAdditionally, India’s Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora announced the country will use blockchain to prevent lost votes and increase voter turnout in remote regions where voters are often unable to vote due to registration restrictions. Regulators are currently working with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras to develop the system. Links to Aadhaar, India’s unique identification authority and issuer of Indian citizens’ 12-digit identification codes have been proposed as a way to ensure identity verification. While India has not expressed a timeline for implementation, Arora has acknowledged that he hopes it will be finished before his tenure ends in April 2021.As voter distrust and the need to digitize elections grows, the fundamental principles of blockchain brings us closer to enabling secure and trustworthy e-voting. The trick is to apply the technology in a holistic way that shifts the need to trust other individuals to a trustless system.The most basic capability blockchain offers — immutability — allows it to verify and record transactions from its network of nodes without fear of tampering from outside sources. Blockchain also allows for the addition of privacy features, enabling voters to submit their choices without fear of exposing their identities or political views. Users can still see that their votes were recorded and counted, but only they will know who or what they voted for.If we take the time to educate communities on how blockchain works and provide explanations around what these features do, voters will feel more comfortable with this technology making its way into the election process. Once the “fear of the unknown” is alleviated, the development and adoption process of these blockchain-based voting systems will accelerate. Until then, communities will view blockchain as a confusing “mess” of technology, pointing out any negative thing and instigating fear that it’s difficult to use and impossible to control if something goes awry. When actually, the opposite is true — if implemented correctly.For now, the best thing we can do is keep innovating while educating the naysayers, developing blockchain technology as a promising component of e-voting, pushing its limits and weeding out any weak links. There is room for improvement and growth, and if we continue to innovate together, the blockchain industry can help to create e-voting systems tailored to various election needs around the globe.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Reuben Yap serves as the project steward for Zcoin, a global privacy-first digital currency.

41607, Does Bitcoin Have Intrinsic Value or Is It Based on Thin Air? ,2020-03-20t12:44:00+00:00,11972,245,"In early March, the Bank of England’s governor-designate, Andrew Bailey, said that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. He controversially stated that any investor that holds Bitcoin should be prepared to lose all of the money. Bailey said, “If you want to buy it, fine, but understand it has no intrinsic value. It may have extrinsic value, but there is no intrinsic value.”Throughout the past several years, many high-profile investors and government officials such as billionaire Mark Cuban, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and United States President Donald Trump have criticized Bitcoin for its lack of real value.Argument for why Bitcoin does not have any “intrinsic” valueIn July 2019, President Trump echoed the sentiments earlier shared by Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger when he claimed that the value of Bitcoin is “based on thin air,” implying that it has no intrinsic value. At the time, President Trump said:“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”The argument for the lack of value in Bitcoin derives from its origin: a decentralized and peer-to-peer network of miners, users, developers and node operators that has been running since 2009 without the presence of a central entity or a group that oversees the blockchain protocol.Hence, the concept that a decentralized and completely open-source network, which in theory is software, is foreign to many investors. In 2018, Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger said that Bitcoin is “worthless, artificial gold,” describing it as a piece of clever computer science. Munger told CNBC:“Bitcoin reminds me of Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting: ‘The pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.’”Most of the negative stances towards Bitcoin and the skepticism about its value stems from its distributed structure and the digital nature. But, cryptocurrency industry executives and prominent investment firm operators perceive the value of Bitcoin differently.Crypto industry experts disagreeIn an interview with Cointelegraph, BlockTower Capital chief investment officer Ari Paul explained that the value of Bitcoin comes from the control it gives to users that own the asset. The non-confiscatable characteristic of Bitcoin provides users with an unprecedented level of financial freedom when compared with traditional assets.Safe haven assets like gold, for instance, which investors foresee Bitcoin would compete against over the long run, have seen many instances wherein gold held by individuals were seized by governments in the past. Paul told Cointelegraph:“BTC is many things: its value comes as the only way to pay for Bitcoin blockchain space (aka censorship resistance as a service), but I’d argue far more of its value comes from its seizure resistance. If I want to store $1 of wealth in a way that can't be arbitrarily seized by governments, I need to own $1 of BTC, regardless of BTC’s price per dollar. With that framing, it’s vaguely comparable to the offshore banking system which is roughly $30 trillion.”The argument that the value of Bitcoin comes from its seizure resistance goes in line with the sentiment of Wences Casares, the CEO of crypto custody and wallet provider Xapo. In an essay titled, “The case for a small allocation to Bitcoin” published in March 2019, Casares suggested that every $10 million portfolio should have at least $100,000 invested in Bitcoin with a long-term investment thesis.Casares explained that growing up in Argentina, he saw his family lose their savings three times over, and the last time was due to unfair confiscation of assets.Related: Crypto Traders Explain What Caused the Bitcoin Price Plunge to $3,000sFounder of Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph that whether Bitcon has any “intrinsic” value purely depends on the perception of an investor of Bitcoin and the entire asset class. By definition, the term intrinsic value refers to the true, inherent and essential value of an asset, commodity or currency. But value is subjective and oftentimes changes significantly based on varying circumstances.As an example, before President Richard Nixon essentially eliminated the gold standard by disallowing the Federal Reserve to reclaim dollars with gold, the “intrinsic value” of the dollar came from the backing of gold. But when the gold standard was abolished, other countries started to print money and the inflation rate of reserve currencies began to rise.A case can be made that the intrinsic value of a reserve currency is the government or the country behind it, but the value of it can change rapidly depending on varying factors, according to Greenspan:“Intrinsic value is defined as ‘an investor’s perception of the asset’s value,’ so whether Bitcoin does or does not have it depends entirely on the perspective of the prospective investor. Perhaps it holds no value for Mr. Carney at this time, but it certainly has value to millions of other people around the world.”Why Bitcoin’s “intrinsic value” can increase over timeDespite the emergence of trusted custodians and strictly regulated exchanges that have contributed to the establishment of a rapidly improving infrastructure supporting the market, Bitcoin is still an emerging asset.Since the Dow Jones fell sharply on March 12 due to heightened levels of fear from the coronavirus pandemic, Bitcoin has shown a high level of correlation with the U.S. stock market. This tight correlation has devalued the image of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. Prior to March 2020, BTC was never tested under an environment where the global financial market started to crash and show signs of extreme uncertainty.Related: Bitcoin Price Correlates With Traditional Assets, but Not EntirelyThe volatility of BTC and its correlation with stocks this month primarily stem from the fact that its market capitalization is still hovering at around $116 billion. That is merely 1.37% of the $8 trillion market cap of gold.As the market cap of Bitcoin increases over time, it will show less volatility and increased levels of stability, which would allow it to be seen as a safe haven asset in times of global market slowdown. Tyler Winkelvoss, the billionaire CEO of U.S.-based crypto exchange Gemini, said recently on the matter:“Bitcoin is not a hedge to pandemics, it is a hedge to fiat regimes. A sudden, negative demand shock in the global economy’ will affect every asset, including gold, in the short term. The world will get through this, but at what long-term, Faustian bargain? Bitcoin is not making any deals right now. It has the resilience and endurance to last in the infinite game.”With a larger market cap, stronger infrastructure, higher liquidity, clearer regulatory frameworks and increased levels of mainstream awareness, the value proposition of Bitcoin can improve significantly over the next decade. And eventually, the argument that Bitcoin lacks “intrinsic value” is likely to weaken, as its non-confiscatable characteristic, decentralized nature, and fungibility will add to the asset’s value."

41602, Cred Partners With NBA Star Spencer Dinwiddie to Promote Crypto Lending ,2020-03-20t13:00:00+00:00,5616,125,"Crypto-based lending and borrowing platform Cred is partnering with professional basketball player and entrepreneur Spencer Dinwiddie. A special page has been launched since March 20 for Dinwiddie’s fans to use Cred.The platform lets users earn interest on stablecoins and other crypto assets, with the company advertising a 10% annual interest rate. Lending is also possible by collateralizing the user’s crypto assets.The partnership targets Dinwiddie’s fans to let them earn interest on their stablecoins. Commenting on the announcement, he said:“This partnership comes at a critical time, where I can educate my fans on the power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain while they earn interest on their digital assets.”Cred spokesmen emphasized to Cointelegraph that using a partner page is the only way of accessing the platform without a concierge.According to its website, the funds are used to “lend and transact with a variety of customers, including retail borrowers and money managers with well-established track records.”The highest interest rates currently offered on Dinwiddie’s dashboard are 6% on Bitcoin (BTC) and 8% on TUSD, if not using Cred’s LBA token. The platform requires locking the assets up for at least six months, though the interest payments are monthly and are delivered either in fiat or cryptocurrency.Part of the revenue from the initiative will be donated to the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, which provides college scholarships to disadvantaged and at-risk youth.An unlikely duo, or so it would seemWhile Dinwiddie’s fame comes from his basketball career, the self-styled “Tech guy with a jumper” has already been strongly involved with blockchain.As Cointelegraph reported in September 2019, he announced the launch of Dream Fan Shares, a tokenization project based on Ethereum. The project seeks to launch “Professional Athlete Investment Tokens,” which give accredited investors the ability to purchase securities tied to the financial success of the athlete.The project’s first security should have been Dinwiddie’s contract. The NBA did not approve the transaction, however, and it is unclear if the initiative has moved forward since. The website offers no information on that account.Looking at Dinwiddie’s Twitter feed, the athlete’s sympathy toward the blockchain and crypto world seems clear.One tweet in particular focuses on what he believes to be structural issues in the world economy, where the total amount of debt exceeds the amount of wealth. He also recently retweeted Anthony Pompliano and Erik Voorhees, both known for their enthusiasm for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto.The partnership with Cred, which may seem strange at first, appears to be a reasonable venture for the NBA player."
41601, PAX Gold Can Now Be Traded Against Swiss Franc and British Pound ,2020-03-20t12:23:00+00:00,2917,87,"While global stock markets are experiencing extreme turmoil, cryptocurrency projects keep introducing more ways to trade gold-backed assets twenty-four hours a day.PAX Gold (PAXG), a major cryptocurrency pegged to physical gold, has now rolled out for trading against two European fiat currencies — the Swiss franc (CHF) and the British pound (GBP).The new trading pairs became available when Switzerland-based digital asset exchange Smart Valor listed PAXG on its platform on March 19.As announced by Paxos, the New York-based company that launched the gold-backed token in late 2019, PAX Gold can now be traded on Smart Valor against four fiat currencies like CHF, GBP, the euro and the United States dollar (USD). The token is also trading against major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) as well as a major USD-pegged stablecoin Tether (USDT).While Smart Valor claims that the exchange is the first European crypto exchange to list PAXG, a spokesperson at Paxos confirmed to Cointelegraph that the exchange is the first platform enabling users to buy PAX Gold with CHF and GBP. Additionally, PAX Gold is said to be the first gold-pegged asset listed on Smart Valor.The Paxos representative said that other exchanges listing PAXG are Kraken, HitBTC, BitThumb and itBit.Amid the ongoing crash, there is increasing demand in alternative investmentsOlga Feldmeier, CEO of Smart Valor, said that the listing of PAX Gold comes in response to the ongoing financial crisis fueled by the intensifying coronavirus pandemic. As the U.S. Federal Reserve announced March 15 that it would cut interest rates to 0%, Feldmeier emphasized the further risks of devaluation:“With the breakout of the coronavirus we also might be heading into the deep recession like the Great Depression of the 1930s. This is the time when investors are in dire need for a real alternative to protect their savings. Therefore, we decided to move forward with listing of tokenized gold on SMART VALOR exchange.”Paxos highlighted that gold held steady amid the market turmoil over the past weeks, outlining gold as a safe-haven asset. The company also stressed that Paxos is a regulated trust company as it was approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services.As reported by Cointelegraph, Paxos launched PAX Gold in September 2019 as the “first crypto-asset redeemable for physical gold.”The exchange said that the PAXG has been also attractive to investors because the Ethereum-based token is accessible for trading twenty-four hours a day. As some traditional market players like the New York Stock Exchange announced that they would temporarily halt trading due to COVID-19 risks, crypto markets become increasingly attractive for investors in general.Gunnar Jaerv, COO of digital asset custody firm First Digital Trust, commented on the matter to Cointelegraph, saying:""With stock markets being suspended and fears of a recession, digital asset markets may become an unexpected source of liquidity for many. Operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week cryptocurrency and tokenized securities markets will not stop, even if it seems the rest of the market might."""
41599, Bitcoin's Price Recovery May Take Months: Fundstrat Analyst ,2020-03-20t12:02:00+00:00,7388,77,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) road to recovery could be a long one, according to Rob Sluymer, a technical researcher at market research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors.Per Bloomberg on March 20, Sluymer wrote in a recent note that Bitcoin’s price action was severely compromised by the recent price drop. He wrote:“The crypto breakdown over the past week mirrored the ‘get me out of everything’ panic that dominated all asset classes, whether they were defensive (bonds and gold) or not (equities). [...] Lower highs and lower lows are in place for Bitcoin, leaving in a compromised, potentially vulnerable longer-term profile.”Still, Sluymer admitted that Bitcoin stayed above its 200-week average, which he believes to be a major long-term structural support level for most assets. He also pointed out that this indicator worked for Bitcoin in both 2015 and 2018, adding:“For now, technically we will again give Bitcoin the benefit of the doubt that it is attempting to bottom but recognize Bitcoin will likely need months of consolidation to repair the technical damage now in place.”Sub-$5,000 Bitcoin sees major buying pressureVijay Ayyar, the head of business development at crypto exchange Luno, pointed out that there was a major buying pressure for Bitcoin under $5,000, which indicates seller exhaustion:“These prices were potentially below running cost for many miners, and we’ve seen hash rates drop. Miners are also better off just buying Bitcoin at such prices so there could be that aspect as well.”As Bitcoin approaches the expected halving of the block reward in under two months, Ayyar expects the prices will reach $6,500 again before stabilizing between $3,000 and $6,000 until the next bull run, concluding:“This is classic redistribution and would be very healthy for future Bitcoin price action and if we were to have bullish momentum going forward.”As of press time, Bitcoin’s price already broke $6,500 to trade at $6,700, up nearly 20% over the last 24 hours.A change in Bitcoin’s investor expectationsWhile the recent cryptocurrency downturn resulted in a loss of confidence in Bitcoin, the rebound that came shortly after shows that optimism has returned among some investors. The founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, Raoul Pal, recently said that he is quite bullish on Bitcoin after the asset recovered by about 80% in just one week.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Italy’s Banco Sella recently launched a Bitcoin trading service as part of its smart banking platform Hype."
41596, $2 Million of MakerDAO Debt to Be Wiped as Auction Reaches Final Stages ,2020-03-20t11:13:00+00:00,2466,84,"Bidders have already committed to buying Maker (MKR) tokens for a total of $2 million in Dai (DAI) as the first phase of the MakerDAO debt auction reaches its final stages.The majority of the current winning bids were placed at around 1:25 a.m. EST, March 20, so unless further bids come in, most of the lots will be sold at around 7:25 a.m. EST.Going once…In the first phase of the debt auction, 40 individual lots, valued at 50,000 DAI each, were released and have received bids, meaning that a total of $2 million will be wiped off the debt of $4 million incurred as a result of last week’s Ether (ETH) market instability.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, the format is that of a reverse auction, whereby bidders commit to buying ever-decreasing amounts of MKR for their 50,000 DAI bids.The starting bid on each lot was for 250 MKR, with a minimum decrease of 3% for each subsequent bid.Going twice…At the time the first lot was released, the MKR price stood at around $245, meaning that $50,000 worth of DAI was being bid for $61,250 worth of Maker tokens. However, as bids for lower amounts of MKR came in, its price started to rise.The currently winning bids on the majority of lots were placed for 188.6792 MKR, when the price was $270.02, representing $50,947.16. A further 3% drop on the amount of MKR being bid for would take the value down to $49,418.74, or less than the Dai being bid.At around 6:00 a.m. EST, the MKR price hit $305, which saw fresh bids on seven of the lots, taking them down to 183.1837 MKR.At $305 per Maker token, bids could go as low as 164 MKR and still be making a profit.Sold!Bidding on each lot will close either 6 hours after the last bid, or 72 hours after the first, whichever is sooner. Therefore, the lots which have received fresh bids will end later than the others.Further gains in MKR price could encourage additional bids on more of the lots, as fresh bidders enter the auction. Prior to the price spike this morning, all 40 of the lots were evenly divided between three participants, but all of the new bids are from different addresses.However, as things stand, the majority of lots are set to end very shortly, in what can be seen as a successful debt-reducing mechanism as part of the MakerDAO Protocol.The second wave of lots is expected to become available on March 22."

This means that the EY, Microsoft and ConsenSys-developed protocol is available to the public.With transactions on the Ethereum blockchain being public and available for all to see, businesses requiring data privacy have tended to deploy their own private blockchain or an enterprise version of Ethereum.However, using zero-knowledge proofs, off-chain data storage, and distributed identity systems, the Baseline Protocol allows businesses to utilize the public Ethereum chain while keeping sensitive data private. According to ConsenSys:“The protocol will support tokenization and decentralized financial services on the Mainnet in a way that doesn’t reveal corporate assets or activities to unauthorized parties, and it leaves enterprise data safely in traditional systems.”Business use caseAnnouncements regarding the protocol have so far mainly focused on product procurement. Purchase orders can be tokenized and dealt with through smart contracts, while a demo included with the code performs real-time calculation of bulk discounts on purchases.However, according to the documentation supplied on GitHub, it is flexible enough to be used for other business activities, and has been, “designed such that it can be extended and applied to any database/workflow.”If you love something, set it freeAs Cointelegraph reported, the Baseline Protocol code was launched and released to selected parties by invitation at the start of the month. The code has now been donated to the public domain through non-profit standards organization OASIS.The work will be governed by the Ethereum-Oasis project, which is managed by OASIS and funded by the Ethereum Foundation and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance."

I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement.”However, Loeffler’s tweets appear to have done little to placate the public, with Twitter user ‘DTBbyTheSea’ writing:“Cool cool.

Investors included Square Enix, B Cryptos, Mindfulness Capital, and True Global Ventures.Sebastien Borget, COO of Pixowl and of TSB Gaming, gave his thoughts on the recent investment:“The Sandbox is a pioneer in the space of blockchain gaming, NFTs, and true digital ownership, and we are thrilled to have Square Enix with us as a strategic investor, supporting our ambitious vision of building the Metaverse where Creators can make games on their LANDs and trade ASSETS on our marketplace in a totally decentralized manner.”Borget told Cointelegraph that the involvement of a major game developer like Square Enix is big news for the platform.Indeed, Square Enix itself has acknowledged the potential of blockchain in gaming. In a new year’s letter, the firm’s president Yosuke Matsuda said the technology will be a key growth factor for Square Enix in the future:“Meanwhile, games using blockchain are no longer in their infancy and are gradually coming to represent a more significant presence. Rather than treating blockchain gaming as an opportunity for speculative investment, we believe establishing whether it is capable of bringing something new to our customers’ gaming experiences will be the key to growth.”Square Enix developed major hits in the gaming industry such as the latest addition in the Tomb Raider series and the long-awaited remake of Final Fantasy VII that is slated for release in April.Tokens can be utilized for TSB gameplayTSB is a virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain to allow players to build, own and monetize their own voxel gaming experiences.As the namesake suggests, SAND tokens can be utilized in the game.

In his view, large corporations like Facebook should be able to issue tokens and control the ""medium of exchange and store of value.""However, the LDP member said the “unit of account” must be controlled by the government. Otherwise, Yamamoto argued, average people would forget about traditional fiat currency.""We must protect it (the role of a unit of account) no matter what. If Japan doesn't issue a digital currency and people in the world use other digital currencies, the Japanese yen will be forgotten and lose its sovereignty.""Yamamoto points out that a digital yen could act as a sort of bridge currency between other digital currencies. Even if Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (GAFA) issue their own tokens, he says, they will be used within their own walled gardens and not have interoperability between them. He thinks CBDCs can fill that gap.""It is easiest for operators to use just one currency but for customers it is inconvenient.""Japan should adopt a CBDC quicklyIn an interview with Reuters last month, Yamamoto said Japan should create its own digital currency, hopefully “within two to three years”. Speaking to Cointelegraph Japan, he said that the ideal time frame for such a move should be as quickly as possible.Yamamoto thinks it is ""meaningless"" if blockchain is not used for a CBDC because it can track when money is stolen, with Know Your Customer checks implemented for transactions above a certain amount of money.The Cointelegraph Japan interview in this article was contributed by Yoshihisa Takahashi and Hisashi Oki."
41587, Researchers Reveal Crypto Mining Botnet's Sneaky Tactics ,2020-03-20t05:16:00+00:00,1693,72,"The cybercriminals behind the crypto mining Stantinko botnet have devised some ingenious methods to evade detection.Malware analyst Vladislav Hrčka from cybersecurity firm ESET sounded almost impressed as he unveiled the firm’s latest findings, and potential countermeasures, in a blog post. “The criminals behind the Stantinko botnet are constantly improving and developing new modules that often contain non-standard and interesting techniques,” he wrote.The half-million strong botnet has been active since 2012 and was spread via malware embedded in pirated content. It mainly targets users in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. It originally focused on click fraud, ad injection, social network fraud and password stealing attacks. However, in mid-2018, it added crypto mining to its arsenal with the Monero mining module.Task Manager won’t help youThe module has components that detect security software and shut down any competing crypto mining operations. The power hungry module exhausts most of the resources of a compromised machine, but cleverly suspends mining to avoid detection the moment a user opens Task Manager to find out why the PC is running so slowly.CoinMiner.Stantinko doesn't communicate with the mining pool directly, instead using proxies whose IP addresses are acquired from the description text of YouTube videos instead.Constantly refining techniquesESET released its first report on the crypto mining module in November last year, but since then, new techniques to evade detection have been added, including:Obfuscation of strings – meaningful strings are constructed and only present in memory when they are to be usedDead strings and resources – addition of resources and strings with no impact on the functionalityControl-flow obfuscation – transformation of the control flow to a hard to read form and which makes the execution order of basic blocks unpredictableDead code – code that is never executed, the only purpose of which is to make the files look more legitimateDo-nothing code – addition of code that is executed, but doesn't do anything. This is a way to bypass behavioral detectionsIn the November report Hrčka noted:“This module’s most notable feature is the way it is obfuscated to thwart analysis and avoid detection. Due to the use of source level obfuscations with a grain of randomness and the fact that Stantinko’s operators compile this module for each new victim, each sample of the module is unique.”Web based crypto jacking decreases after Coinhive shutdownIn related news, researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Lakehead University in Ontario, Canada this week released a paper called: ""Is Cryptojacking Dead after Coinhive Shutdown?""The Coinhive script was installed in websites and either overtly, or surreptitiously, mined Monero — until a big fall in the price of Monero during ‘crypto winter’ made it unprofitable and the operation was shut down.The researchers checked 2770 websites that had previously been identified as running crypto mining scripts to see if they were still infected. While just 1% were actively mining cryptocurrency, another 11.6% were still running Coinhive scripts that were trying to connect to the operation's dead servers.The researchers concluded:""Cryptojacking did not end after Coinhive shut down. It is still alive but not as appealing as it was before. It became less attractive not only because Coinhive discontinued their service, but also because it became a less lucrative source of income for website owners. For most of the sites, ads are still more profitable than mining."""
41584, Justin Sun’s Steemit Accused of Censoring Hive Related Content ,2020-03-20t02:18:00+00:00,3364,96,"In the latest development in the Steem (STEEM) saga, Justin Sun has come under fire for censoring posts on the platform related to the community-driven ‘Hive’ hard fork.On March 19, cryptocurrency influencer Girl Gone Crypto Tweeted a clip to say that her “neutral explainer video” about the March 20 fork had been removed from the Steemit platform:“I made a really neutral explainer video just kind of walking through the announcement, and what’s happening, and what people can expect, and that post was just removed from Steemit.com. What’s really ironic about this is that centralization issues and censorship concerns are exactly why the Steem community is forking the chain and moving to Hive.”Cointelegraph has reached out to Tron for comment and will update this story if we hear back.Steem community proposes hard fork to reject Justin Sun takeoverThe Hive hard fork was announced on March 18 — essentially a community-led backlash to Tron founder Justin Sun’s attempts to dominate the network.On Feb.14, Sun purchased Steemit Inc, the largest front-end interface to the Steem blockchain — acquiring roughly 20% of the total supply of STEEM tokens in the process. The acquisition prompted calls from the Steem community for a hard fork to prevent Sun’s tokens from being mobilized for voting on governance.After purportedly informing major crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi of an upcoming upgrade, the two exchanges voted alongside Sun’s Poloniex to oust the Steem blockchain’s 20 node operators on March 3.Following the backlash, Huobi and Binance have since withdrawn their votes backing Sun and announced their support for the Hive hard fork — which will airdrop HIVE tokens at a 1:1 ration to STEEM, with the exception of the founder’s reward held by Sun.Hive garners widespread community supportThe Hive hard fork appears to be supported by a large majority of Steem community members, with the price of STEEM skyrocketing over 200% within 16 hours of the fork’s announcement.On March 19, Steempeak, Steem’s second-largest front-end interface, ran a poll querying community members as to which chain they intend to support after the fork. Scott Jarvie, the co-founder of Steempeak, told Cointelegraph that he identified near unanimous support for Hive among the 200-plus responses that the post has received so far.“I have read through every post and am hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't want to move to Hive. We asked them to be honest and we would make sure they wouldn't get attacked on comments if they were firm in their resolution to stay on Steem.”Jarvie notes that the community “expects that Hive will have some issues to start”. “I hope our users understand this but it's gonna be a bumpy beginning as we set up more DECENTRALIZED infrastructure,” he said.Steempeak will be launching a Hive-based website with a new domain name that will be announced in the coming days."

The trend has accelerated in recent weeks as the supply increased.The Bitcoin Cash network has larger blocks and lower fees than Bitcoin itself. If a significant proportion of Tether moves to the Bitcoin Cash network, that may help reduce demand on the Ethereum network and gas fees.Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether said:“A key strength of Tether is that it is underpinned by a rich diversity of different blockchains. Our latest collaboration with Bitcoin Cash will provide Tether with a variety of benefits. We expect the adoption after launch to be pretty easy for any integrator. The launch will also support more applications on the Bitcoin Cash chain, with Tether facilitating payment for these applications.”Bitcoin Cash’s Bitcoin.com wallet was recently upgraded to enable its 10 million users to access SLP tokens via the app, which will now provide them access to USDT as well.Roger Ver, Executive Chair of Bitcoin.com said:""It's extremely exciting to hear that the world's biggest stablecoin will be using the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain and that the millions of Bitcoin.com wallet holders will be able to send and receive Tether using SLP tokens."""

It has since been shared countless times in Telegram and other social media.User ‘nottodaymonk’ posted that his friend had just “got off a Goldman Sachs Investee call where 1500 of their investee companies dialed in”. He listed several “takeaways” from the call, the most significant of which was a prediction of “global health and economic collapse” in 6 to 8 weeks.That’s not quite right says Goldman SachsPatrick Scanlan, vice president of corporate communications at Goldman Sachs, sent the following statement to Cointelegraph, distancing themselves from the reported comments:“The comments being circulated on social media platforms attributing statistics on COVID-19 to Goldman Sachs were prepared by an unidentified author, were not authorized, and contain erroneous information and attribution. On March 12, the firm’s chief economist and chief medical officer held a call for clients, during which they conveyed information on the economic and market impact of COVID-19. During the call, various statistics on the pandemic were cited and attributed to legitimate sources including governments and were not necessarily presented as a Goldman Sachs view. The market and economic views presented on the call were consistent with current published research views.”Goldman Sachs did not explicitly deny the veracity of nottodaymonk’s claims, however it queried some of the statistics presented. The company stressed that “the market and economic views” expressed during the call were consistent with its public reports.Goldman Sachs’ public views on the economic impact of coronavirusAn official Goldman Sachs report from March 15, “US Daily: Downgrading Our US GDP Forecasts” predits “real GDP growth of 0% in Q1 (from +0.7%), -5% in Q2 n (from 0%), +3% in Q3 (from +1%), and +4% in Q4 (from +2¼%)”.Source: Goldman Sach Economic ResearchOn an annual basis, Goldman Sachs downgraded its 2020 GDP forecast to 0.4% from 1.2%. For reference, in 2019 the U.S. economy expanded 2.3%.While the references to a ‘beer virus’ (Corona) make it clear the notes are not verbatim, it is certainly possible that the numbers reported by nottodaymonk were discussed in the call — and a recent report from London’s Imperial College also contains some morbid forecasts that make Goldman’s report pale in comparison."

However, IOV Labs — the firm behind RSK — anticipates that others will join soon.The advantages of blockchain in gas managementGasnet aims to manage service providers, carry out transactions when new installation or reconnection certificates are registered, and improve regulatory oversight. To achieve that, the network utilized RSK smart contracts and its RIF second-layer solution. It was launched in collaboration with Argentina-based software development company, Grupo Sabra.RSK and Grupo Sabra started developing the network for Gasnor in 2019. Now, Enargas authorized the expansion to a national ecosystem available to all distributors willing to adopt it. The regulator and Gasnor are both running their own nodes of the Gasnet network. Gasnor chief information officer, Carlos Amín, commented:“The implementation of the blockchain solution [...] will enable [us] to streamline our processes, reduce costs, improve time to market, and most importantly provide a much better user experience.”Blockchain use in the fossil fuel industryBlockchain is becoming increasingly useful within the fossil fuel industry due to the technology’s ability to help manage complex ecosystems and supply chains. As an analysis published by Cointelegraph in February suggests, oil firms have begun using blockchain to make the industry safer, cleaner, and more efficient.Saudi Arabia’s state oil company, Saudi Aramco, purchased $5 million shares in a blockchain trading platform called Vakt at the end of January."
41569, Vitalik Reveals His Vision For the Next Decade of ETH 2.0 Development ,2020-03-19t22:30:00+00:00,5252,161,"Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed his personal roadmap for ETH 2.0 in a tweet on March 18. The post covers the next 5 to 10 years of the project’s development.Progress is in actionIn the post, Vitalik emphasized that research and development will continue regardless of recent challenges. In addition, he pointed out there should be less fear of complexity with the system update, noting that many of the upcoming changes will address these previously noted issues. He added that:“The ""quadratic sharding as end of history"" approach ensures there will not need to be a further upgrade as large as the eth1 -> eth2 one; rather, from eth2 onwards things will be much more incremental.”In the post, Vitalik looked back at the last two years of Ethereum’s development. He stated that:“In general, over the last ~2 years there has been a solid shift from ""blue sky"" research, trying to understand what is possible, to concrete research and development, trying to optimize specific primitives that we know are implementable and implement them.”Varying responses from the crypto communitySome responded to the post positively, stating that they are looking forward to the project’s continued evolution. However, by press time, the most popular comment was one which speculated on how the proposed development schedule would affect the price of Ether.Source: Vitalik TweetEthereum 2.0 still on schedule to launch despite recent market volatilityLast month, Vitalik told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview that the project’s main goal for this year is to launch Phase 0 of ETH 2.0. After the launch, ETH 2.0 will begin as an independent proof-of-stake network.As Cointelegraph market analysis reported a few days back, the price of Ether rose from around $130 at the start of the year to $274 by mid-February, a 111% gain. Following the recent market correction, the price of Ether dropped as low as $86. At press time, Ether’s price has recovered to around $137 USD."
41568, Kentucky Distiller Tokenizes Up To $20M of Bourbon Whiskey ,2020-03-19t21:39:00+00:00,1896,80,"United States-based Wave Financial Group will manage the tokenization of up to $20 million worth of bourbon whiskey produced by Kentucky-based Wilderness Trail Distillery.Wave told Cointelegraph in an email sent on March 18 that the firm will tokenize between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels of liquor so it can be offered through a specialized digital asset fund. The “Wave Kentucky Whiskey 2020 Digital Fund” will allow investors to purchase tokens linked to the inventory of whiskey barreled this year, which is estimated to represent up to four million bottles of bourbon.According to Waves, the tokenization grants investors exposure to the spirit’s value appreciation and a share of the proceeds from its sale expected for three years after the distillation. The selected bourbon could reportedly increase its value from $1,000 per barrel at distillation to $4,000 five years later.Wave is also in discussion with security token exchanges to allow for secondary market trading of the bourbon-backed tokens. A firm’s spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the blockchain that will host the tokens has yet to be determined, but given the involvement of Tezos-partnered (XTZ) development company Vertalo, Tezos seems likely.The advantages of tokenizationA Wave spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the advantage of blockchain-based tokenization of such a fund is that it makes it cheaper for investors to access exposure to the asset and provide liquidity to the secondary market. The firm’s president and fund manager Benjamin Tsai pointed out that the approach made investing in the spirit much more accessible:“The [fund] provides investors a rare opportunity to access this unique asset class traditionally unavailable due to high upfront costs and purchase minimums, low liquidity, scarcity of production capacity, and technical know-how.”The representative also explained that the firm applies traditional investment management techniques to digital assets offering funds allowing investors cryptocurrency exposure.Luxury items and blockchainBlockchain-based ledger immutability is seeing use in the luxury goods industry as a way to ensure authenticity and tracking of the products. In March 2019, it was reported that premium scotch whiskey brand Ailsa Bay — owned by liquor firm founded in 1887 William Grant & Sons — was releasing what it believes to be the world’s first scotch whiskey tracked on the blockchain.In mid-May 2019, reports suggested that luxury fashion brand Alyx intended to use Iota’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) for supply chain tracking."

Beyond the markets tanking, the risk of spreading the highly contagious virus has led many countries to tell citizens to stay home — with obvious implications for broader workforce productivity and resulting in the cancellation of many events in the crypto space.Beyond telling businesses to stay closed and people to socially isolate, governments around the world are taking unprecedented steps in economic policies in response to the virus.Cointelegraph presents an ongoing list of government suspensions of crypto-relevant policies and practices. We will be updating this story as further events warrant.March 19: New York suspends mortgage payments for 90 daysIn a press conference, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state will temporary waive mortgage payments for borrowers facing financial hardship without hurting their credit scores. Cuomo explained the 90-day waiver:“If you are not working, if you’re working only part-time, we’re going to have the banks and financial institutions waive mortgage payments for 90 days. That will be a real-life economic benefit. It will also be a stress reliever for many families.”March 18: Trump suspends foreclosures and evictions until the end of AprilPer a press conference on Wednesday, President Trump announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will stop foreclosing or evicting renters and homeowners as an effort to provide “immediate relief.”March 18: New York Stock Exchange closes trading floor, continues electronic tradingAs Stacey Cunningham, president of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), announced, the New York Stock Exchange will be closing down its legendary trading floor starting March 23.The NYSE will transition to a fully electronic model for the time being will present a format already familiar to crypto investors. In Cunningham’s words, “we continue to firmly believe the markets should remain open and accessible to investors.”March 18: U.S. IRS puts off deadline to pay taxesAs Cointelegraph reported, the United States tax authority announced on March 18 that it was delaying the typical due date for taxpayers to file from April 15 to July 15.The IRS’s addition of a question about cryptocurrency to this year’s tax forms has necessitated greater reporting from crypto holders. However, the issue of taxation remains fraught with uncertainty. In December, a group of Congresspeople wrote a letter tothe IRS concerned about the agency’s lack of clarity on hard forks and airdrops. The delay will give crypto-holding taxpayers more time to get their accounts in order.March 17: Spain shuts down short-sellingAs Cointelegraph reported on March 17, the Spanish securities regulator shut down short-selling to tamp stock losses as a result of Coronavirus panic.In the words of the National Securities Market Commission, the effort was designed to combat “the risk of disorderly trading taking place in the following weeks.”March 17: U.S. Senator calls for halt on work that doesn’t fight COVID-19Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) — the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee — called on the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a roster of financial regulators including Chairman Jay Clayton of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to put a halt on all rulemaking not in response to the Coronavirus. In the letters, Brown wrote:“We urge you to implement an immediate moratorium on rulemakings not related to the virus response or other imminent health and safety concerns.”The actual impact of Brown’s request remains to be seen. Given the SEC’s ongoing struggle to determine which digital assets to treat as securities, a freeze in the commission’s operations likely has the most bearing on crypto. The office of Chairman Clayton declined to comment on how the commission planned to respond to Brown’s calls.The office of Sherrod Brown did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for more information as of press time.March 15: U.S. Federal Reserve pauses cash-holding requirements for banksIn an announcement on Sunday night, the U.S. monetary authority announced a series of emergency measures to curb economic damage.Cointelegraph previously reported on the Fed’s emergency reduction to 0% interest rates. These emergency measures also included a reduction in reserve requirements for banks. Since 1992, the Fed has required that banks hold 10% of the value of their transaction accounts on-hand in reserves. Beginning March 26, that number will drop to 0%, meaning that account holders may have trouble with in-person cash withdrawals.Bloomberg has noted the increased demand for cold hard cash among some bank account holders worried about the Coronavirus.At least one Bank of America client has already spotted a reduction in available cash withdrawals. Tatiana Koffman, managing director at Mantis VC, told Cointelegraph that on March 16 a branch in Los Angeles that typically allows cash withdrawals of up to $20,000 without issue told her they had imposed a limit of $3,000. Koffman says the bank’s justification was: ""They have to impose a limit because too many people were showing up asking for cash.""As far as Cointelegraph could determine, by March 17, the same branch had resolved this limit, though a representative at the bank did make a point to encourage non-cash withdrawal options. National representatives for Bank of America did not respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment as of press time."
41564, Keyless Wallet Provider Zengo Now Holds SGA Stablecoin ,2020-03-19t21:01:00+00:00,1174,69,"Saga Monetary Technologies’ SGA stablecoin is now compatible with keyless wallet ZenGo, thanks to a recent partnership between the two companies.“ZenGo provides guaranteed access, meaning that even if we stop operating, user funds will remain 100% available for the users to move them anywhere they wish,” ZenGo CEO Ouriel Ohayon explained to Cointelegraph about the keyless wallet.Users can now hold their SGA tokens in ZenGo’s wallet, Saga said in a March 19 statement. ZenGo’s wallet does not employ private keys. ZenGo’s main wallet will now hold SGA compatibility, a representative confirmed to Cointelegraph.The collaboration has an approach different than traditional walletsTraditional crypto wallets rely on private keys as a backup for stored funds. Safe private keys essentially mean safe funds. Alternatively, “leveraging advanced biometrics and cutting-edge cryptography,” ZenGo takes a different approach without private keys, the statement said.Saga Monetary Technologies founder Ido Sadeh Man said current global uncertainty pushes crypto and non-crypto folks toward stability. The founder referred to currency value fluctuations and people’s search for a different option aways from such fluctuations.“Saga was designed to remedy these concerns in the sense that it is backed by a basket of the five most traded national currencies on one hand, and, on the other hand, it is gradually progressing towards independence, as its economy grows,” Man told Cointelegraph.Users need simple solutionsMan also said that such options need simplicity to be accepted by the public, adding:“ZenGo is extremely appealing in this regard, as they have managed to allow users to hold a wallet without needing to bother themselves with keeping the private keys secure, spreading them around, and being so concerned about security. At the same time, ZenGo allows users to remain in full custodianship over their funds, without actually needing to turn to a custodian.”Simplicity appears to be key in the public eye, as a recent study from Edelman showed Generation X, Z and Millenials all voted lack of knowledge as the largest barrier to entry into crypto. A more simplistic approach might invite new users as it would not require as much additional knowledge."
41562, Scammers Impersonate World Health Organization to Steal BTC COVID-19 Donations ,2020-03-19t20:35:00+00:00,4154,117,"As the number of global coronavirus cases grows each day, online scammers are turning to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) to steal money under the cover of the global pandemic.According to cybersecurity firm Sophos, some online perpetrators are now impersonating the World Health Organization (WHO) in an attempt to steal cryptocurrency donations to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.Scammers look to profit from the recently launched COVID-19 Solidarity Response FundChester Wisniewski, a cybersecurity expert at Sophos, reported on WHO impersonators in a March 19 tweet, posting email screenshots from scammers. According to Wisniewski, the fraudsters are trying to mislead people into sending them Bitcoin as a donation to WHO’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund that was launched on March 13.The WHO established the new coronavirus fund in partnership with the United Nations Foundation subsequently after the agency officially classified Coronavirus as a pandemic on March 11. As announced, the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund launched with support from Internet giants like Facebook and Google, inviting individual donors to support the fund through the official website.The fake donation request reported by Wisniewski doesn’t refer to the website at all, however. According to the screenshot, the impersonators ask the potential donors to donate by sending Bitcoin directly to an address given in the email. The impersonators are also using a forged address, donate@who.int, in order to defraud people, according to data from the security researcher. As of press time, both listed Bitcoin addresses in the fake emails are empty, according to data from Blockchain.com’s explorer.Screenshot of fake email requesting Bitcoin donations for the WHO.

A spokesperson at the WHO told Cointelegraph that the organization doesn’t accept donations in Bitcoin for its COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.As reported by Cointelegraph, a number of governments have already warned the public about the outbreak of crypto scams trying to capitalize on the widespread fears relating to COVID-19. On March 11, the United Kingdom (U.K.) Financial Conduct Authority issued an official warning about coronavirus scammers using all the possible ways to mislead people into giving them money. The regulator wrote:“Watch out for scams related to coronavirus (Covid-19). These scams take many forms and could be about insurance policies, pensions transfers, or high-return investment opportunities, including investments in cryptoassets.”Previously, the U.K. police also warned about coronavirus scammers requesting payments in Bitcoin. Cointelegraph also reported on coronavirus-themed ransomware known as CovidLock that infects users’ devices and asks payment of $100 worth of Bitcoin in exchange for a password that would return control of the device to the owner.Update 19:00 UTC, March 23: This article was updated to specify that the World Health Organization doesn’t accept donations in Bitcoin for its COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund."
41561, If Cryptocurrencies Were Beer… ,2020-03-19t20:25:00+00:00,7620,90,"Whether crypto markets are up or down, people will still buy beer.The American beer industry has seen a 600% increase in the number of breweries between 2008 and 2016, according to data from The Atlantic. And the crypto industry really boomed from nothing in 2008 with the release of pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper. By 2017, thousands of new digital assets built on top of that work had found their way onto exchanges. Nowadays cryptocurrency lives somewhere in the public consciousness between a Bloomberg headline and a subculture.Cryptocurrency remains less than 100% accessible to the general public, but plenty of adults of legal age understand beer references. In that spirit, please enjoy this playful explainer of which crypto is like which beer.Bitcoin (BTC) is BudweiserA standard American-style lager, Budweiser is an immensely well-known beer available in establishments east to west and beyond. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of contemporary India Pale Ales or bespoke sour beers, but it can still come through as a simple, reliable drink that many folks enjoy.Bitcoin gets the job done similarly in the crypto world. As the first cryptocurrency available to the public, it’s not the fanciest, latest thing. But users know what they’re getting when they use it — reliability and brand persistence.Just as Bitcoin’s implications (with regard to forking) lead the charge of a thousand cryptocurrencies, Budweiser’s parent company, Anheuser-Busch, is responsible for several other beers and brands.Litecoin (LTC) is Bud LightPositioned as a less filling, lower calorie alternative, Bud Light does not claim to be the real Budweiser, but rather takes its place as the popular alternative. Bud Light is obviously built on Budweiser’s impact, but has the potential to serve a different purpose, depending on the customer.Litcoin’s creator, Charlie Lee, describes LTC in relation to its usability and mass appeal. At one point in time, some headlines called Litecoin the figurative silver to Bitcoin’s gold.It’s worth noting that Litcoin confirms transactions more quickly than Bitcoin.Ethereum (ETH) is Blue Moon Belgian WhiteA mainstream, entry-level craft beer, Blue Moon Belgian White has an arguably different, more robust flavor panel than a Budweiser. Watch me stretch this to how Ethereum built on what Bitcoin started.Blue Moon has a number of different flavors that go beyond its basic Belgian White designation, including Honey Wheat, Harvest Pumpkin Ale, White IPA and more. Ethereum was similarly the foundation for a multitude of initial coin offerings built on its blockchain.Additionally, many beer aficionados do not really classify Blue Moon a top-tier craft beer, much in the same way many parties criticize Ethereum for its scalability and performance issues.Ripple’s XRP is Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat AleA popular choice, Goose Island 312 exudes the flavor and hoppiness of a fairly solid craft beer, although some enthusiasts might not call 312 a craft beer at all. Goose Island is owned by large-scale brewing giant, Anheuser-Busch, arguably disqualifying it as craft beer — some say that designation is partially characterized by a brewery’s small operating size.In the same way, many argue about XRP’s connection (and alleged centralized ties) to the large tech company Ripple. The XRP asset is fast, but many crypto enthusiasts knock its status as a true cryptocurrency, historically based on Ripple’s reported hefty coin stash. But XRP still gets the job done quite nicely as a method of digital value transfer, and has shown traders and market participants significant price action over the years.(Yes, Blue Moon is also owned by that large conglomerate called MillerCoors, but acknowledging that would collapse the analogy!)Chainlink (LINK) is 3 Floyds Brewing Zombie Dust American Pale AleThe hype around Zombie Dust is real.“Zombie Dust has maintained a level of hype that’s almost unheard of for a daily drinker,” according to a 2018 ChicagoMag article. “One Chicago store even hung a sign: ‘It has been __ hours since we’ve been asked for Zombie Dust.’”The hype is real because the product is real. Zombie Dust beer boasts a “world-class” score on BeerAdvocate.com for its unique flavor and aroma.Chainlink also touts similar hype and a posse. Its loyal fan base is affectionately known as the “Link Marines” on Twitter. The asset is generally well-received in the crypto space, and its project aims to solve the notorious “oracle problem” — a core issue in linking digital assets to real-world assets.Whether we’re talking beer or crypto, it often helps to step back and see the lighter side of the industries in which people reside."
41560, Talking Digital Future: Quantum Computing and Cryptography ,2020-03-19t20:15:00+00:00,4139,76,"Back in the 2000s, when I worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), I was the director of technology and innovation. Part of that role was not only helping the company and some of our clients with tech innovation projects, but it was looking out five years, 10 years, 15 years and thinking about what technology was emerging and what it might mean for our industry. And so, all along the way, I’ve had a real interest in identifying things that are interesting that maybe a lot of people weren’t paying attention to yet.One was the role of speech recognition. I was making the case that we would start to talk to our machines and there would be a more natural and progressive interface to use voice. The other one was called social computing, which later became known as social media. Another one was virtual reality. I did a lot of work with what, at the time, was called immersive worlds and a particular protocol called Second Life. Do you remember Second Life? It’s still popular today. It’s a world in which you can make your own persona. You can make friends, you can build things, there’s even a currency. I found blockchain to be similar at first. It was fascinating.And then I stumbled upon quantum computing. Quantum mechanics, of course, is many decades old, but my radar, so to speak, detected that things were starting to happen. I would read, for example, about Google hitting a certain, what they call, qubit milestone. More companies — whether D-Wave or Microsoft, Fujitsu or others — were starting to publish their positions on quantum and where they think it’s going. And I think the real clincher for me was a book called “Hit Refresh,” where Satya Nadella — the book’s author and the CEO of Microsoft — is betting the future of Microsoft on three things: artificial intelligence, mixed realities and quantum.A significant, influential, trillion-dollar business in the world is betting its future on this technology, as is Google. So I started to learn about it.Related: Will Google’s Quantum Supremacy Break Bitcoin in 2020?It was a much harder topic than I had anticipated, but I got into the topic research and then I proposed a course to LinkedIn Learning as an author, and they agreed.The computing dilemmaAll throughout my career, the microprocessor — the classical computer — has been the enabler of incredible positive outcomes for the most part. The microchip enabled the smartphone, the internet, better health care, better cities, better manufacturing, better products. And it continues to be very effective. Computers continue to get faster. Software continues to get better.But there’s an interesting underlying trend that’s been happening that, for most of us, is only visible as chips are made smaller but also have more performance built into them. On a small microchip the size of a quarter or even a small coin, there are millions, if not billions of tiny little switches. Being able to fit more and more onto this very small silicon semiconductor is about as close to magic as it gets.What we’ve discovered is that we will soon get to a physical limitation that there are only so many of these switches that can be put into a certain amount of space before reaching the atomic level. And once at that level, we will start to confront a different layer of physics, which is called quantum mechanics.Because our processors are getting smaller and smaller, our ability to continue to have faster computers in the future will start to slow down, because we can’t put billions more switches on this one tiny thing. So here’s the dilemma we’re faced with.We will either realize that we can only get computers to a certain speed, or we will train more computers together for a higher performance. Or we wonder, well, what’s going to take us from this peak that we’ve reached with computing power to the next generation so that we can solve the biggest problems of the 21st century? And it turns out — we have a few options. One of them is to develop a completely new computing platform based on quantum mechanics.Fast computingOnce we break through to quantum computing, there will be no limits. We will suddenly be in a whole new place where, what would take a classical computer a month to process (like weather computations), a quantum computer could initially do in minutes and eventually in seconds.There are chemistry problems that have become so complex that we can’t even solve them today in classical computing. And if we do try, it’ll take 10 years for the computers to turn out a result. Quantum will do it in seconds. So, we’re going to go from what we think is fast computing today to really fast computing. It’s going to open up incredible opportunities for humanity. However, quantum computing creates a lot of risks and some real issues — but that’s the case with everything, right? With any kind of technology comes someone who uses it with malicious intent. So there are also going to be consequences.Social impactThe social impact of quantum computing is a big question, because we have to break it down bit by bit. Although, one aspect is that with better computing power, we can perform better, have better services, and solve problems that were once hard to solve, like making better predictions on health outcomes. So when we go to a hospital today, we ride on the expert judgment of doctors, and they do quite well. Perhaps in 30 years from now, we’ll look back and say, “wow, we trusted the doctors.” When artificial intelligence is supported by inconceivably fast processing speeds that can go through many permutations, we can hopefully get treatment plans that are much more accurate than they are today.Quantum vs. blockchainA lot of people have identified quantum and blockchain as something worth exploring. Personally, I don’t like to go too far out because the future is always a little unpredictable. But the risk to blockchain from quantum in the short term is that there is no risk.Related: Quantum Computing Vs. Blockchain: Impact on CryptographyNow, what that really means is — we got a head start. Cryptography works because it’s hard to break the encrypted scheme. It’s hard to unencrypt it because the amount of computations it would take makes the effort not feasible. So when exceptionally fast performance is brought into the equation, that limitation suddenly becomes less of a burden, because you can go through many more permutations to find the unencrypted passwords or even to reverse a hash. If the very core of what makes blockchain work is suddenly not as locked down as firmly as we thought, we should be concerned.I believe we have time. But in the long term, there is a risk. So we need to be very active in alternative mechanisms, and there is already some interesting work being done on them.If blockchain can be broken by quantum, all cryptography can be broken. And that’s a much bigger societal risk. Think about your bank, your browser, your smartphone or your laptop — computing has been integrated into all levels of our life. All those levels rely on existing cryptographic algorithms and are vulnerable in one way or another.Related: Is Crypto Ready for the New Space Age?One of the promising aspects here is that quantum actually makes excellent cryptography. There’s a thing called quantum cryptography, and it’s very different from our understanding of how classical cryptography works. Quantum cryptography is used today in a small amount of applications. Some interesting research in this field shows that while quantum can break existing cryptography and make it useless, it actually introduces a different forum which could be used to fix the problem. I think it’s fascinating that the very thing that breaks cryptography also fixes it.There is actually a silver lining — quantum cryptography is much more secure than our consumer-base-level cryptography in society today. We could see quantum cryptography be the answer and even be actually integrated into future versions of blockchain, making blockchain a quantum-based system itself. Some interesting theoretical experimentation is being done on this very topic.Related: The Future of Crypto: The Latest Cryptography Advances Set to Change BlockchainHumans are awesome. We will come up with other ideas. It won’t just be quantum fixing the same problems it creates. And I’m also very confident that blockchain will evolve in the decades ahead.Related: How the Crypto World Is Preparing for Quantum Computing, ExplainedLimitationsWe are in the early days of quantum computing — but that’s probably an understatement. We know it works. Part of the history of quantum in the last 10 to 15 years has been trying to make something work and it isn’t repeatable. If you can’t even do a math problem and repeat the same answer each time, you don’t have a viable pathway. But now we’re there. We’ve broken through this barrier and we have good, solid, predictable quantum computing.Because quantum computing is so completely different from what we once knew, we have to build everything from scratch: the hardware, the operating systems, the applications, the databases. Everything has either been remade or is undergoing an overhaul. We can’t port anything.In my video series, I make the joke that you can’t run Microsoft Windows on a quantum computer. There is no such thing. You can’t just run Ethereum on a quantum computer. So, we have to build the entire computing stack and build an ecosystem. If a quantum computer is slower than the fastest classical, well, the obvious answer is to just use a classical computer because it does run Windows and Ethereum. So for quantum computing to be feasible, you have to have a quantum computer that is faster than a classical one from the get-go.This is called quantum supremacy — the point at which a quantum computer is faster than the fastest classical computer. We have not reached quantum supremacy yet, or at least it isn’t recognized by the consensus. There are some companies that say we’ve done it, while others debate, but we have to have full confidence that a quantum computer is able to make a calculation much faster than we know how to do it with even the fastest conventional supercomputers available. But even if that goal is achieved, there is a serious limitation for quantum computer adoption and usability. It starts with the difficulties in building the needed hardware as well as the computers’ enormously large size (which seems to be a step back from the mobility of the 21 century).As quantum computers improve over time, they go through the same process as conventional computers — there’s always a new classical algorithm to test against the quantum ones, and it is continually raising the bar for quantum supremacy. But there exists a limitation for quantum supremacy: building the required hardware which would be able to control and stabilize processes on subatomic level.The equivalent of classical transistors or processing capabilities in a quantum computer are called quantum bits, or qubits. They’re basically the quantum equivalent of bits on a microchip. We can have computers that have 12 qubits and 14, and 18 and 22. In fact, the highest we think in the broad quantum space is Google’s most recent quantum. The tech giant’s quantum AI lab says it has 72 qubits. And it means that they’re able to process in a stable way — that is, recreate the same outcome for an algorithm.Why not just have lots of qubits together and tether really quickly? I wish it were that easy. In order to actually process an algorithm against a qubit, we need a high level of stability. As when you get to the subatomic level — where things do not follow the traditional rules of physics — the random motion at that level would make individual atomic events become an unpredictable and uncontrollable system, and these motions can generate internal energy as well as the various external factors that can also create movement and produce energy. One way to make atomic systems stable is by cooling them down, resulting in reduced movement, which means less energy will be expelled. In fact, the lower a temperature is, the more stable an atomic world becomes. But that means you’re not going to have a quantum computer in your house anytime soon, because the refrigeration factor is huge. Cooling the system down stabilizes it and thus reduces the chances of qubits incorrectly flipping in between quantum states.Decoherence is still the primary limitation of quantum computing today. And every bit of effort, all the big energy, is on how to create better decoherence. Or, should I say, premature decoherence, because you need decoherence to measure the result, but you don’t want decoherence when the processing is happening.Finally, there’s really no such thing as full tolerance yet. In classical computing, which is so reliable, there’s an awful lot of full tolerance happening. Software is failing all the time, but when a switch fails, another switch turns on and is able to account for the errors. We don’t have that in quantum yet. It’s a space that needs a lot of innovation, because if we’re going to have reliable and fast processing, we’ll need the ability for redundancy and accounting for errors in the system, and making those invisible to the end user.Energy consumption issues?One of the things that we need to recognize regarding quantum is we probably won’t ever own a quantum computer. There won’t be a quantum chip on a smartphone or a laptop, but quantum will flip the way that most of us are thinking about it. Most of the big innovators — the Microsofts and IBMs — the way they see it, quantum computing is heading toward cloud provision.Quantum becomes just another service that can be tapped into. So one could argue that maybe in the future, there won’t be millions of quantum computers, just a lot of really big ones owned by the government and some prominent tech companies, then energy consumption won’t be such a big deal.Digital future and crypto on cubitsOne can imagine that in 20 or maybe 30 years from now, the world will run on quantum computers. All our systems will run on quantum, which will have a small quantity of classical computing plugged in to run on our local devices, but generally, the performance of our systems, organizations and society will be running on quantum. We’re not yet at the point where we can say with 100% certainty, as there will be lots of interesting twists and turns along the way, of course.On the other hand, there is very deep government involvement in developing quantum-based infrastructure, including most members of the G-20. There are a couple of ways to think about it: There are benefits to being the first and being the innovators. The United States has typically pushed the envelope on the information age. And one of the reasons it was able to do that is because it had a head start by developing and attracting the world’s brightest minds, supporting technological and engineering initiatives and funding fundamental scientific research, while many other countries had other distractions.Today, that’s not the case. China wants to be the first to have powerful quantum computers, while England still remains a community driven great power. Both examples are investing in innovation development from the government side.Many national governments globally are also funding quantum research because it’s a competition for who can be the first to break through. No doubt, there’s also an important military application, and it seems like a lot of the conflicts we might have in the future would be sort of the lone actor — terrorism. And we need really good software and analytics to try to predict and mitigate in that particular arena. So, I could definitely see quantum computing being very valuable.Many countries have official policies. If you look to China, the United States or the European Union, you’ll see that there are quantum policies, if not articulated in operational terms, then certainly philosophical, like with the EU saying things like, “We believe quantum is important and we want to research it at these universities.”I don’t know what the upcoming quantum coin would entail. But you have yourself a glass of wine and think about what that might mean. That’s some big thinking right there.This article is from an interview held by Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr with Dr. Jonathan Reichental.

41559, Can Blockchain Technology Counter US Anti-Message Encryption Bill? ,2020-03-19t20:10:00+00:00,3319,98,"The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is attempting to alert the public to a bill that seeks to end the encryption of online messages and prevent it from being enacted by the United States Congress.The so-called EARN IT bill proposes that digital messages should first pass through government-approved scanning software in order to monitor for malicious criminal activity. The bill is sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal.Blockchain as a measure against government surveillanceThe bill’s disregard for privacy presents an open-ended use case for technology like blockchain. By offering transparency and traceability alongside security, blockchain-based communications may be a way to avoid governmental prying.An example is blockchain’s use by journalists and activists to circumnavigate censorship measures by governments worldwide.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Sarah Zheng, a journalist for the South China Morning Post, had leaned on the Ethereum blockchain to publish a censored interview with a Wuhan doctor who alerted the public about the coronavirus outbreak.According to Zheng, blockchain made it possible to encrypt the information with QR codes, morse code, and deliberate typos it could be shared on social networks. The original piece could not be disseminated via WeChat.Specifics of the EARN IT billThe EARN IT bill features a series of “best practices” that online entities would be expected to follow. The EFF claims that Section 230 protections would be withdrawn from any website which fails to uphold these guidelines. If enacted, this list will be created by a government commission led by the U.S. Attorney General, William Barr.The foundation says Barr has made it clear he would fully ban the encryption of all digital messages. If this bill is passed, it would give law enforcement legal access to any communications sent between individuals online. The EFF clarifies the following about Barr's influence on the bill:""Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr's veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.""Propaganda against encryption?Although Senator Blumenthal correctly notes that the word ""encryption"" has not been included anywhere in the bill, the EFF maintains that the proposal is an ""all-out assault"" on encryption.The Electronic Frontier Foundation adds the following regarding the EARN IT bill:""You can't have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys."""
41558, New Blockchain System to Track Individuals Not Infected With High-Risk Viruses ,2020-03-19t20:06:00+00:00,2587,149,"The Netherlands-based Public Health Blockchain Consortium (PHBC) has announced the release of a blockchain-based system designed to track the movement of individuals not infected with high-risk viruses. The impetus behind the development is to help healthy people avoid potentially life-threatening diseases.The PHBC announced the release on March 19, detailing that the blockchain-based platform will monitor systematic, continual and anonymous verification of communities and workplaces, which are not afflicted by dangerous viruses, including the Coronavirus.Recording virus data on blockchain“The blockchain stores a workplace's or community's protection certificate from security organizations or government bodies to assure that all persons who enter a safe zone are continuously monitored,” the PHBC further explained the system’s operation. If a person previously visited an infected area, they are required to stay in a quarantine zone, wherein communities can provide isolated places of residence to incoming visitors.Ayon Hazra, the administrator for the PHBC, said:""PHBC's virus-free monitoring blockchain can automatically identify zones with and without validated incident reports by integrating real-time information from virus surveillance providers with artificial intelligence and geographical information systems. Those areas without validated reports of contamination are elevated to safe zone status. Communities and workplaces can maintain such safe zone status if they restrict access to anonymously identified persons and only allow movement to and from other safe zones.""Blockchain in health proliferatesThe coronavirus outbreak has pushed blockchain companies to more actively develop health-focused applications and systems. Tech firm ConsenSys will spin off its health devision, which will explore blockchain application to the health industry, citing issues such as rising costs and access to care as some of the areas where blockchain can contribute.China-based tech startup Hyperchain announced the launch of its blockchain-based platform to fight against the coronavirus epidemic. The platform will focus on medical supply donations, ensuring that the donation process is immutable, traceable and reliable."

41554, Huobi's Mining Arm Records 547% Surge in Operating Revenue in 2019 ,2020-03-19t19:46:00+00:00,1119,69,"Huobi, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume to date, saw significant progress in its crypto mining business in 2019.Huobi Pool, a cryptocurrency mining arm of Huobi, says its operating revenues surged 547% in 2019, reaching $320 million year-over-year from $53 million in 2018.PoS staking continues to be the Huobi Pool’s most profitable businessOriginally launched in March 2018, Huobi Pool released its first annual financial report on March 19, announcing the news for Huobi Group’s digital assets mining business and trading pool for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.Alongside major growth in operating revenue, Huobi Pool recorded notable profits. According to the report, Huobi Pool’s operating profit jumped 218% from $2.5 million in 2018 to $6.3 million in 2019.As outlined by the company, the two main triggers for Huobi Pool’s growth in 2019 were Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining. Having accounted for 35.62% of the total net income, PoS continues to be the Huobi Pool’s most profitable business segment so far, the firm noted. Huobi Pool also projected that PoS will continue to be a focus in 2020.PoW consensus is also still contributing to total net incomeAs reported by Cointelegraph, PoS is a consensus blockchain algorithm that operates on the basis of the validator's stake in the network. PoS is opposed to PoW, which relies on physical miners instead of network validators.Despite some blockchain projects like Ethereum trying to get rid of PoW consensus, the algorithm is apparently still profitable to date. According to Huobi Pool’s latest report, at least 23.5% of the firm's total net income in 2019 was contributed by PoW mining. Additionally, PoW mining became one of the fastest-growing business segments of 2019 for Huobi Pool, as its Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate reached a high of 6,578 PH/s.In the report, Huobi Pool also highlighted its Huobi Pool Token (HPT) as a central part of the company’s business model. In contrast to Huobi’s native token Huobi Token (HT), Huobi Pool Token is specifically designed for the company’s mining arm, acting as a reward mechanism for hashrate contribution as well as a way for users to participate in Huobi Pool developments.As of press time, both Huobi Pool Token and Huobi Token are seeing significant surges over the past 24 hours, up nearly 15% and 14%, respectively. The growth comes amid a major green trend on crypto markets, with Bitcoin getting back above $6,200 and jumping more than 18% over a 24-hour period as of press time, according to data from Coin360."

Moreover, the analysis indicated an increased skepticism surrounding blockchain, with financial institutions beginning to drive a bearish narrative in regard to blockchain’s prospects.As a recent study by a market research firm Research Dive showed, the global blockchain Internet of Things market size could reach $5,802.7 million in 2026. However, a lack of awareness among companies could be a critical factor influencing this projected rise.Financial organizations explore blockchainIn the meantime, China Ever­bright Bank, a major commercial bank in China and one of the world’s largest public companies, debuted a blockchain-based supply chain finance solution by Ant Financial. Major European financial institutions are also jointly launching a blockchain-based platform for the investment fund industry."
41552, UK Police Reports 562 Cases of Bitcoin-Related Blackmail Over Last Two Years ,2020-03-19t19:33:00+00:00,1147,80,"United Kingdom police forces have received hundreds of blackmailing complaints since 2018, in which nefarious parties demanded Bitcoin (BTC).By tracking numbers from 2018 and 2019 across thirteen U.K. police teams, think tank Parliament Street found 562 reports of blackmailers demanding Bitcoin, said a March 19 statement provided to Cointelegraph.Some places saw a larger spike than othersEngland’s North Yorkshire Police force saw a massive spike in reported Bitcoin blackmailing cases in 2019. The outfit reported a mere six incidents in 2018, while 2019 yielded 115 accounts, the statement detailed.One report showed ransomware efforts in which a hacker locked down all of a user’s business data. They then demanded bitcoin as payment for unlocking the data, threatening to increase the price tag for restoration if the victim did not pay up within a certain timeframe.Another report showed a perpetrator threatening to release private information into the public if a victim did not send over BTC.Some areas faced a high concentration of attacksReports showed several regions with high Bitcoin-related crime numbers. These included 89 accounts from the Greater Manchester Police, 82 from Hertfordshire, and 21 from Leicestershire.“The rising tide of digital financial crime will bring a shiver down the spine of consumers, who are already acutely aware of the risk of fraud and blackmail from malicious hackers,” Retail Financial Consulting CEO Andrew Martin said in the statement, adding:These incidents underline the risks associated with online currencies, which are often an easy way for anonymous third parties to extort money from victims, without detection.Martin also added a note for the future. “Moving forward, it’s time for the big banks to recognise that the aggressive push towards a cashless society is forcing many people to experiment with new forms of investment, some of which come with significant risks,” he said, including,“Restricting consumer access to cash limits choice, leaving many people in our society behind and in an increasingly dangerous online world, this can only be a bad thing.”By the numbers, Bitcoin demands represented around 4% of all blackmail attempts in the U.K. between 2018 - 2019. The other 96% of cases involved demands for traditional fiat currencies."
41551, Shadow of Steem: Crypto Exchanges Choose to Govern User Deposits Differently ,2020-03-19t18:53:00+00:00,2280,118,"Crypto exchanges have become the most powerful stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem. Currently, just 12 crypto exchanges hold around 2.5 million Bitcoin (BTC) in their wallets, worth around $15 billion. That’s 13.8% of all Bitcoin mined to date — or, 16%–17% of all Bitcoin in circulation, considering lost Bitcoin (as of March 19).Exchanges are also some of the largest holders of altcoins, which recently led to a controversy when some of the biggest crypto exchanges used large stockpiles of Steem tokens to take over Steemit.Just like Steem, Tron’s consensus is also delegated proof-of-stake, and its biggest representative is Binance, which holds over 54% of the votes. So, when Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ) made a friendly reminder to Justin Sun that “transparency works,” he had a bit of leverage — albeit not his own, as those tokens were likely customer deposits.Exchanges as crypto oligarchsHow did exchanges become so rich and powerful? After all, an exchange is just a platform that facilitates trading, not a bank or an investment fund. Even the platforms themselves state: “Binance provides an online digital asset trading platform,” Huobi “is a platform dedicated to the transaction of digital assets,” while “Kraken provides you with a simple and convenient way to trade [...] digital assets,” etc.In an ideal decentralized world, there would be no centralized exchanges. Unfortunately, decentralized exchanges are not capable of providing their users with the same kind of convenience and scale. This technological frailty gave rise to the gigantic centralized exchanges of today, which have become the biggest digital asset custodians in the world.Unsurprisingly, their size makes them an irresistible target for hackers and prone to various mishaps, costing their clients billions of dollars and tremendous grief. As Oren Katz, the vice president of engineering at Starkware — a company whose goal is to bring on-chain transactions to exchanges and release them of the burdensome custodial duties — put it:“We have spoken with all the major crypto exchanges, some get very excited about our solution, some don’t. For some, it’s a bug, for others, it’s a feature. They say ‘people trust us, we have a good reputation.’”Not only is custody of customer deposits a feature, but it can serve as a source of additional revenue when exchanges engage in hypothecation — a practice that occurs when an institution uses deposits or collateral for financial gains. Exchanges can lend their deposits and earn interest, they can stake them to earn rewards, or even use their customers’ assets to influence elections in various DPoS schemes that could potentially benefit them as well.Terms of useBefore discussing the issue of whether exchanges should be allowed to use their customers’ deposits for their own gain, let’s look into something that most users never bother reading: the “terms of use” or “user agreements” of some of the most popular exchanges. And since most of the exchanges’ agreements don’t spell out their policy toward user deposits, Cointelegraph has reached out to all the exchanges discussed in this article.BinanceBinance’s terms of use don’t seem to shed much light on the issue of using customer deposits. There is a passage that states, “Binance maintains full custody of the funds.” However, this refers only to “remaining funds after account termination due to fraud, violation of law, or violation of these terms.”In addition to not being fully transparent about its handling of user deposits, Binance refuses to disclose its legal status. When a Maltese regulator declared that Binance doesn’t possess “an official license by MFSA,” Changpeng Zhao went to Twitter to say:“Binance.com has always operated in a decentralized manner as we reach out to our users across more than 180 nations worldwide. As well as pushing the envelope in experimenting how to become a true DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).”Binance has not responded to an inquiry for comment.CoinbaseOf all the exchanges that were examined, Coinbase has one of the most explicit and progressive policies:“Coinbase will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, or otherwise alienate Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet unless instructed by you.”Also, the policy states that unless otherwise specified, Coinbase doesn’t support any digital assets that have “staking, protocol governance” functionality.Coinbase did not respond to our inquiry.OKExOKEx’s terms of service explicitly prohibit hypothecation — adding that Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd, a Seychelles legal entity that operates OKEx, will not use funds without user authorization:“Digital Assets deposited or acquired by You through the Aux Cayes order matching platform or the C2C platform will be held by Aux Cayes in the digital wallet maintained by Aux Cayes on your behalf. [...] Aux Cayes will not use your VFAs as security or in any way make use of your VFAs, other than as lawfully directed by you and with your prior authorisation. VFAs held by Aux Cayes on your behalf may be pooled with those of other Users.”In a statement released to Cointelegraph, an OKEx spokesperson reiterated that the exchange doesn’t engage in hypothecation:“OKEx assures clients would have full control in respect to their asset custody in OKEx. We support a proper industry standard on segregation between client money and house fund.”HuobiHuobi’s global user agreement doesn’t explicitly mention its handling of the user deposits. The only somewhat relevant information that is available states:“This Website only provides online transaction platform services for you to engage in digital asset trading activities through this Website (including but not limited to the digital asset transactions etc.). This Website does not participate in the transaction of digital assets as a buyer or seller.”Huobi hasn’t replied to an inquiry from Cointelegraph.BitfinexBitfinex is yet another exchange that doesn’t include its handling of users’ deposits in its terms of service. However, it admits that “from time to time” it may “act as principal, counterparty, or market-maker in the transactions” and yet “its orders, trades and other transactions will be treated the same.”Its security policy page states that most of the funds are stored offline in cold wallets and “only approximately 0.5% of crypto assets are accessible in hot wallets for day-to-day platform operations.”Bitfinex hasn’t responded to Cointelegraph’s request for inquiry.BitMEXBitMEX is another major exchange whose terms of use don’t specify how it treats customer deposits. However, it warns its users of the inherent dangers of trading on the exchange:“You acknowledge and agree that the Services should only be used by you if you:i) have knowledge and experience in highly volatile markets;ii) are trading with Bitcoin you can afford to lose; andiii) have a high risk tolerance.”It also asks users to acknowledge that “any Bitcoin withdrawal address you provide is your own and that you have full control over this address.”BitMEX declined to respond to a request for comment, citing the coronavirus threat.KrakenKraken’s terms of service don’t discuss its handling of user deposits. However, there is a proof of reserves page where the exchange declares that it “holds full reserves” and employs ”an independent, cryptographically-verified audit in order to prove to third parties.”Furthermore, Steve Christie, the head of compliance at Kraken, provided Cointelegraph with comprehensive answers regarding their policy on the hypothecation of customer deposits:“Currently, Kraken Cryptocurrency Exchange does not hypothecate customer assets. However, we do look into ways for customers to achieve yield on their assets and continually explore options in this area. For this, transparency is our top priority. We always work with our clients to provide information on how their assets are to be used.”Talking about whether Kraken would support an industry-wide regulation that would control reserve requirements and hypothecation, Christie said:“We don’t typically advocate for industry-wide regulations. Instead we believe open and transparent markets, which allow for the development of innovative products and services. For example, DeFi is a rapidly evolving industry segment that needs space to innovate and ‘experiment,’ so premature regulations on this area could derail development of a potentially industry-altering solution.”BithumbBithumb’s terms of service do not offer much in determining its policy toward user deposits.Cointelegraph has not received a response from Bithumb.Binanace.USThe terms of use for Binance.US don’t specify how the exchange handles user deposits. However, it mentions that it charges a 20% commission on staking.Interestingly, the platform acknowledges that a counterparty to a trade could be a market maker affiliated or related corporations of BAM, while most exchanges state that they are never a party to a trade. Binance.US hasn’t responded to an inquiry from Cointelegraph on the matter.BigONEAlthough BigONE’s user agreement doesn’t mention the treatment of customer deposits, the “About” page clearly states that the exchange safeguards all the deposits:“BigONE keeps users' assets in reserves, and will not deploy the assets by no means. The mechanism provided by BigONE allows users to track the status of the assets at any time.”In addition, Cointelegraph received a response from Randolf Zhao, the vice president of operations at BigONE Exchange. Zhao confirmed that the exchange doesn’t practice hypothecation: “At BigONE, we do not hypothecate customer deposit funds under any circumstances.”On the issue of industry-wide regulation, Zhao noted that regulation is “a double-edged sword.” Although it can be useful, the cost of implementation eventually will be transferred to the users.Zhao believes that self-regulation is the optimal approach. Furthermore, he pointed out that if regulation were beneficial for the growth and development of crypto exchanges, one would expect to see United States-based exchanges dominating, which is not the case:“If we take a look at where the biggest and most successful crypto exchanges are registered these days, you have to wonder why American crypto exchanges are not as dominant as its Internet sector.”CEX.IOThe terms of use of the London-based exchange CEX.IO do not elucidate the points of the inquiry; however, Alona Dobshynska, the chief product officer at CEX.IO, provided a reply upon request from Cointelegraph.Dobshynska segregates hypothecation into three categories — first, lending and investing of customer deposits; then, staking of customer stake-able coins; and finally, “participating with customer’s coins in governance.” Responding to the first subcategory of hypothecation, she draws comparisons to the traditional financial institutions like banks and concludes by stating:“A crypto exchange is no different from a financial institution. Using the deposits for certain lending / investing activities is in line with maintaining the velocity of digital assets in the market. But the rules about how these funds can be deployed also apply. It means not all, but only low risk and high liquidity, opportunities qualify. For regulated exchanges, such as CEX.IO, and especially in the U.S., the rules for lending/investing are quite shaped, and the perimeter of what’s permissible is clear.”Dobshynska explained that the exchange has introduced staking for its clients that preserves their sovereignty: “The holders remain in full control of their coins — they can pull them out of CEX.IO or trade them any moment.”Dobrynska believes that governance is the most ambiguous area. In traditional finance, brokers are allowed to exercise a vote on the behalf of their customers on a narrow array of issues, but “they have to obtain an instruction from a shareholder on how to vote” on the issue of substance, and she generally agrees with this rule. Noting the latest Steemit controversy, Dobshynska observed:“If we look broadly at some of our colleagues, in light of the recent STEEM situation, absent explicit regulation in our industry, those exchanges made the decisions based on what kind of actors they wanted to be. For clients it is a matter of figuring out whether such a decision aligns with their values or not.”Unalienable right to voteIt is understandable that a young, rapidly developing industry that doesn’t yet have universal standards and that various exchanges may choose to take divergent approaches to the way user deposits should be handled. Yet, a user arguably has the right to know how an exchange treats their deposits. And the argument that stands is that decentralization doesn’t work without transparency, just like taxation doesn’t work without representation.With most of the issues discussed here, analogies with the traditional world can be outlined — and governance is no exception. There is no denying that the Steemit affair was botched by some of the leading exchanges in the industry. Many in the community, including Vitalik Buterin, reacted very harshly to what they perceived as a hostile takeover of a decentralized project by centralized exchanges.Perhaps this latest fiasco will be a turning point for the industry on the issue of delegated proof-of-stake governance just like the DAO fork was for the immutability of the proof-of-work blockchain."

The bigger and more mature a market becomes, the longer new cycles take. With Bitcoin, the cycle of 2014-2018 took four years, while the cycle before that took two years. It makes sense that the current cycle would peak out in 2024-2026 as the market is maturing.Comparing that to the chart of XRP, we can see that this cycle is taking longer, as this level is retested after two years rather than one year. A positive note is if the price copies the movements of 2015, a surge to $0.33 is possible in the upcoming weeks.Is the correlation back between XRP and BTC?XRP BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewA common occurrence during 2017 and 2018 was the inverse correlation between XRP and BTC. Once BTC started to rally upwards, the XRP/BTC pair dropped. The moment BTC began to drop south, XRP/BTC jumped upwards.Lately, this correlation disappeared, and XRP used to move alongside Bitcoin, until last week when Bitcoin witnessed a massive crash from $7,500 to $3,750 within one day. As a result, many altcoins saw a significant drop in their BTC pair as well, but not XRP.During these following days, XRP/BTC gained 23%, balancing their USD value. As stated previously, the weekly candle held the vital support of $0.15, mainly due to the strong bounce in the BTC pair.What else does the chart show? There was an immediate rejection at the 0.00002900 satoshis level, as the price dropped down. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin has rallied in the past 48 hours, reaching $5,900.This strong upside move from Bitcoin caused the XRP/BTC pair to drop massively, as the pair is approaching the 0.00002600 satoshis support level again.What should XRP investors watch for?XRP BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewOne of the essential things to watch for is the correlation between XRP and BTC, as discussed in the previous section.However, the XRP/BTC pair shows a descending triangle structure. There’s strong support found in the green zone, which is found between 0.00002450 - 0.00002550 satoshis. As long as that support holds, it will provide a significant entry.The resistances of this range are mainly found at 0.00002800 - 0.00002900 satoshis and 0.00003150 - 0.00003300 satoshis, alongside with the descending triangle trendline.As the chart is showing, a breakout of the trendline could take until May or June of this year. But, the moment that XRP breaks through the trendline and breaks above 0.00002800 - 0.00002900 satoshis, a clear rally is on the tables with targets of 0.00003800 satoshis. Such a rally would mean a surge of 45% from the current prices.XRP/USD pair is at a crucial areaXRP USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewFor the XRP/USD pair, the $0.15 level is a crucial level to hold, as discussed previously. The primary resistance to break is the red zone between $0.182-$0.195. As long as that area remains resistance, there’s no reason to be bullish on the chart.However, what investors would want to see is a bottom formation like the period in December 2019, shown by the blue rectangle.Through that, a period of sideways movements occurred in which a support and accumulation range was established. After this, the price of XRP started to rally significantly.A similar situation would suit the price well, given that it’s on its final support before $0.06. Holding this area and testing the $0.182-$0.195 area would be an exciting development.An apparent breakthrough of the $0.182-$0.195 resistance area would mean a surge towards $0.32-$0.35 as the next move. If that occurs, then we’ll see XRP copying the previous cycle, but only a bit slower.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

41546, MakerDAO’s First Debt Auction of MKR Tokens Is Successfully Underway ,2020-03-19t16:37:00+00:00,2824,62,"MakerDAO hopes to fill the multi-million dollar gap in the collateral backing its DAI stablecoin following last week’s Ethereum market volatility, as Cointelegraph reported. Today the organization successfully launched its first debt auction to that end.The first lot became available at 10:38 EST on March 19, and just over one hour into the auction, a further nine of the 100 expected total lots had been released.The reverse auction formatSales at this auction take a reverse-auction format, with a fixed bidding amount of 50,000 DAI placed for an initial lot of 250 MKR tokens. Bidders can then lower the amount of MKR that they would be prepared to accept for the bid, but with a minimum decrease of 3%.Each lot will continue until one of two thresholds is crossed: either 6 hours passing since the last bid, or 72 hours passing since the first bid.Time to bag a bargain?With the value of a single DAI pegged to the US dollar, and MKR currently priced at around $265, winning an auction lot with an opening bid would net around $66,250 worth of MKR for $50,000 worth of DAI. But all of the lots so far have seen at least one lower bid shortly following their release.A break-even lot would currently be around 190 MKR at a price of $265, although the minting of that sold MKR will dilute the supply and likely put downward pressure on the price by the end of the auction. But MKR price has actually risen since the auction began, up $20 from an initial $245.The majority of the bidding action is expected to occur toward the end of the auction.

41545, Major Digital Asset Platform in Asia Unveils Exchange for Pro Traders ,2020-03-19t16:23:00+00:00,4998,28,"An exchange designed for professional traders has been unveiled by one of Asia’s leading digital asset platforms.The OSL Exchange offers a single platform login for users, as well as a central dashboard that brings together over-the-counter trading, brokerage, insured custody and wallet services.A “cutting-edge, modular interface” also enables users to purchase and sell some of the world’s best-known digital assets in exchange for U.S. dollars and some stablecoins.OSL is a member of BC Group, the “only listed fintech and digital asset company” audited by a Big Four firm. The launch follows an extensive trial that trading partners and investors participated in.Wayne Trench, OSL’s CEO, said: “With the single login feature, we allow our customers to seamlessly trade and interact across our OTC brokerage, exchange and insured custody products to best serve their needs. Clients have one onboarding journey, one login and one banking channel for all products.”“Unique in the market”OSL says its exchange boasts institutional-grade Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering standards — and all assets across the platform are held in secured, insured hot and cold wallets that enjoy 24/7 protection thanks to multilayer hardware, software security protocols and a team of seasoned engineers.Its market-matching engine can process hundreds of thousands of orders per second, delivering low levels of latency that enable trades to be settled instantly, the company notes.OSL Exchange also supports both Financial Information eXchange protocol and REST (or, Representational State Transfer) API connectivity, as well as collocation on request.Trench added: “We’re in a prime position to service the highest quality participants already in the digital asset marketplace, and to capture capital inflows from the traditional financial services sector.”More insights from OSL hereOther features offered by the OSL Exchange include six tiers for trading charges — effectively meaning that certain users will be entitled to rebates on transaction fees if their volumes surpass a certain level.According to OSL, it was the first to apply for a license in Hong Kong in November 2019 under the Securities and Futures Commission’s newly unveiled framework for digital assets.Crypto insightsAs it welcomes professional traders to its platform, top executives at OSL have been offering insights into what lies ahead for the crypto markets.Matt Long, OSL’s head of distribution, says “further dramatic growth” could be on the way for digital assets as we edge ever closer to Bitcoin’s third halving in May.He argued that global regulatory measures mean that BTC is beginning to be validated in the eyes of financiers that have previously kept a distance — predicting that as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency comes out of the shadows, institutions will be “entering into the fray with full confidence.” Long wrote: “Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital assets are going to become a standard component of asset managers’ portfolios. Notably, we can also expect banks to start rolling out their own coins to the market.”Statistics from Chainalysis help underline Asia’s importance in the crypto market. Its figures suggest that 40% of major exchanges are based on the continent — and that there is more demand for Bitcoin in Asia than in the U.S. or Europe.Illustrating why the launch of platforms such as the OSL Exchange is important, its report added: “It is difficult to overstate the importance of APAC to global cryptocurrency markets. APAC is home to the highest number of top exchanges, receives the most Bitcoin, trades the most volume, and is a driving force in the adoption of stablecoins.”Learn more about OSLDisclaimer.
